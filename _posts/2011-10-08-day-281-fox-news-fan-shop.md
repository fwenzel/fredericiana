Why does no better place come to mind for this than a Texan airport? Houston (George Bush Intercontinental) Airport has a Fox News Fan Shop. I was pondering getting something as a facetious gift for one of my friends, but then couldn't stomach the thought of paying part of Bill O'Reilly's salary any more than I already do via my cable bill ;)
