Today, Tara and I ran our first, <a href="http://brazenracing.com/coyotehills.html">5k foot race,</a> at the Coyote Hills Regional Park in Fremont. We finished the 3.5 miles (that's 5.6 km, trail races tend to be a little longer than their nominal distance) in right about <abbr title="42:21, no. 262 and 263 out of 451">42 minutes</abbr>. Had there not been a few spots where one could not pass for a while, we'd probably have shaved another few minutes off this, but in general, I am happy with the result!

Here are the two proud runners, with their medals, after coming home:

There are also a few more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/sets/72157625934614096/">photos of us running</a> in a set on flickr, taken by some volunteers around the track. Like this one:

How fun!
