Before leaving Las Vegas again, we played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Go_Game">The Go Game</a> (which is essentially a scavenger hunt with Internet-connected cell phones and digital cameras). It was plenty of fun! During one of the "missions" (reenacting our favorite video game), we barely got our 20-second clip shot until a suited security guy told us to knock it off, hah... Guess Casinos aren't made for this kind of game. Still, it was plenty of fun.

If you're lucky, I'll share our team's photos and videos when they're online :)
