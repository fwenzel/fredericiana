This week's Mozilla All-Hands meeting is decorated with various fake road signs, like this one: "Quiet! Programmers at work!"--hold on--<strong>b</strong>rogrammers? "What's a brogrammer?" I promptly <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fwenzel/status/113749700817059840">asked lazytwitter</a>. I quickly got plenty of answers, and one of the most comprehensive ones is <a href="http://www.quora.com/Brogramming/How-does-a-programmer-become-a-brogrammer">this question on quora</a>. Remember: After you call <code>pushCollar()</code>, you always need to call <code>popCollar()</code>! And never forget to drink your <em>brotein</em>!
