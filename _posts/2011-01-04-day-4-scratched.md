How exactly did I manage to put such a deep (but short) scratch into my laptop without noticing it? Looks like something metally bumped straight into it. Strange things happening here!

Photo taken with my cell phone's cam in "macro" mode. Not bad! Next, I think I'll give <a href="http://neilandtheresa.co.uk/Android/Vignette/">Vignette for Android</a> a shot.
