In a <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/state_web_winter">recent comic</a>, The Oatmeal asked tumblr to blame their service outages on an imaginary animal like twitter's Fail Whale and promptly came up with one, the <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/comics/state_web_winter/tumblr.jpg">Tumbeasts</a>.

What's awesome is that Tumblr actually did end up <a href="http://oatmeal.tumblr.com/post/2916375890/thank-you-tumblr">using his artwork</a> on their <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/503.html">error page</a>. This is what it looks like:

<a href="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tumbeasts.jpg"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tumbeasts-439x400.jpg" alt="" title="Tumbeasts" width="439" height="400" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3232" /></a>

Mad props to the Oatmeal and Tumblr for this stellar addition to my <a href="http://fredericiana.com/tag/failpet/">fail pet collection</a>!
