Wow, one of the US presidential candidates has a <a href="http://www.officialfred08store.com/">whole store full</a> of <strong>Fred</strong> merchandise. I totally want a Fred shirt. Or what about a <a href="http://www.officialfred08store.com/eShop/10Expand.asp?ProductCode=FHT1US-3660">Fred cap</a> (that incidentally comes with a fancy star-sprangled banner on the back, what more could you ask for, really? :) )?

I am still considering buying something (but international shipping may be expensive :( ) because over here in Germany nobody will think I am trying to send a political message when in fact I just dig the shirt.
