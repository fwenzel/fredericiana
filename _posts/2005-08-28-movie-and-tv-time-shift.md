<img src="http://photos7.flickr.com/8267370_71382fbfea_t_d.jpg" alt="from flickr, cc-licensed: http://flickr.com/photos/mccord/8267370/" align="right" />Movies and TV series are shown in the U.S. quite a bit earlier than they come to Germany. (They have to be translated etc...) Usually I don't care but when you go to the U.S., you're heavily endangered to miss good films and TV series. - Crap.

I wanted to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/">Sin City</a> in the original, english version while I am still in Germany, but <strong>no</strong> movie theatre anywhere in Karlsruhe shows it in English. They all have the German version, though. Plus, there is no chance to see it in a cinema in the U.S.: The film has already left cinemas for quite a long time and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JNTX/102-6096837-1817763?v=glance">DVD was released</a> two weeks ago. Argh! (Hm, maybe they offer those <a href="http://www.redbox.com/">dvd rental machines</a> in Oregon, soon?)

Another PoA (point of annoyance ;) ) is that <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/">CSI: NY</a> starts on German TV just next week, but the first season has already been on TV in the U.S. a lot of times. I nearly assume, if I eventually happen to get a TV (or <a href="http://freevo.sourceforge.net/">freevo</a>? :) ), the second season will start before I were able to see the first one. *grrmpf*

Okay, you're right: I really shouldn't watch TV at all. It's too frustrating ;)

But I'm going to watch quite a lot of new movies and tell my German friends if it was good - for them to be excited for about two months until the film comes to German cinemas! I am so evil, I know ;) *hehe*
