A week ago, Tara and I took a trip to Lyon, France, and spent a few days basically eating the most delicious food in the universe all day (did I mention the Lyonnaise are the undisputed masters of cooking with shameless amounts of bacon?).

While we were there, I also took a bunch of pictures, such as this HDR image of the Basilica of Fourvière:

Another experiment I made is this wide-screen panorama of the city of Lyon that I later stitched together with <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>.

(you <em>must</em> see this one in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/4754395703/sizes/o/">original size</a>.)

Also, this one is really funny:
