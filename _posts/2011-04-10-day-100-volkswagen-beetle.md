Look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a> I saw at the Great Mall today (don't ask me what year, or model number, or any such things ;)). There are quite a few of them driving around the Bay Area, I noticed. I wonder if all of those are Beetle enthusiasts, or if some of them are owned by people who originally bought it a few decades ago and never saw the need to replace their beetle with a newer car? Either way, the old Beetle seems comparatively much more frequent here in the US than back home in Germany. Who would've thought.
