Today I went to the doctor for a routine checkup, my first doctor's visit in the US (except for a dentist appointment two years ago) and everything went smoothly. In fact, it was remarkably similar to going to a German doctor -- including collecting a copay beforehand, and of course the extended waiting, since a scheduled appointment doesn't mean anyone except the patient actually has to adhere to that scheduled time.

Aaanyhow, the only thing quite different than in Europe is the silly hospital-style paper gown that is carefully designed to complicate the very purpose of the visit: The doctor's look at the patient's body.
