Since the weather in the Bay Area has been craptastic lately, there's an urgent need to counteract the grayness with some deliciousness. Exhibit A: Indian-Style Tomato Sauce (from Bittman's <a href="http://www.howtocookeverything.tv/">How to Cook Everything</a>), which with a little bit of luck is going to turn into Chicken Tikka Masala for dinner. Om nom nom.
