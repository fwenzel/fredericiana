<a href="http://xkcd.com/482/">This xkcd comic</a> is just way too cool to be left unblogged:

<a href="http://xkcd.com/482/"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/xkcd-observable-universe.jpg" alt="" title="xkcd: Observable Universe" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1617" /></a>

Needless to say, due to its ginormous size I needed to cut off the middle part (one of the beauties of its CC-by-nc license), so make sure to click on the picture to see it in all its beauty.

Randall Munroe made a map of the observable universe, from top to bottom, on a logarithmic scale. I love the details ("Eris: All hail discordia!"--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(mythology)">Eris</a> is the Greek goddess of strife, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> in a balloon, or Pluto (not a planet, neener neener)...). It's also cool how funny the buildings look due to the scale.

It's also available as a <a href="http://store.xkcd.com/#HeightPoster">poster</a>!
