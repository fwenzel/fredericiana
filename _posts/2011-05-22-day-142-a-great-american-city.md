I saw this banner on a (well, a dozen) lamp post this week. In general, nothing exceptional, but such things always make me smirk when I imagine just how strange it would be to see something comparable in a German city: A huge German flag, with the words "Hintertupfingen -- eine tolle deutsche Stadt!"
