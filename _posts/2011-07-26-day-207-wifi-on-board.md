Most recently, all VTA light rails that I've ridden had free Wifi on board. It's hooked up to a 4G connection, which seems to be pretty stable and snappy, I like it! Along with the improved schedule (read: I now have to wait less than the previous 15 minutes for my connecting train), this is making my commute almost a breeze!
