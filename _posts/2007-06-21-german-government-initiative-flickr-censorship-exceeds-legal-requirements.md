<img src='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/flickr-unavailable.gif' alt='Flickr: Unavailable' class="alignright" align="right" />When flickr recently stopped showing "moderate" (possibly offensive) and "restricted" (not for children, or your mom) pictures in Germany, people started complaining about arbitrary censorship. Yahoo!/flickr responded, this was <em>due to strong age verification laws in Germany</em>.

Now Friedemann Schindler, head of <a href="http://www.jugendschutz.net/index.html">jugendschutz.net</a> (which is the German government's initiative for youth protection on the Internet), <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/91468">responded</a> to yahoo's claims, arguing that yahoo's "solution" <em>"exceeds the legal requirements"</em>, because as a hosting provider, they are only required to remove illegal content once they are notified of its existence. (Which is exactly what I said about the situation in an <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2007/06/15/on-flickr-censorship-in-germany/">earlier post</a>).

A while ago, flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/43626/">responded to the censorship claims</a> by allowing Germans to <strong>remove the "moderate" restriction</strong> in the preferences, while <strong>"restricted" stays filtered</strong> for German accounts. While this is a step into the right direction (at least we can see average vacation photos again!), at times flickr still looks like this (yes, this is a real screenshot):

If flickr wants to be (or become) "family friendly", I appreciate them banning hard pornography pictures from their platform (this is --really-- not what flickr is for). But this is a change that has to happen in the upload policies (and be enforced accordingly) and not by implementing a highly flawed filtering mechanism that relies on the uploaders' feelings about their own pictures.

After all, while yahoo keeps hiding many entirely harmless pictures from all Germans' sights, other --legally much more critial-- pictures, for example of WW2-nuts reenacting Third Reich scenes, stay unfiltered and readily available for the general public.
