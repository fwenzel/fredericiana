Today, I had to spend many hours driving, so I wanted to listen to some music in the car. Sadly, my iPod's battery was empty because I forgot to recharge it soon enough.

In order not to be without music altogether even though I was running out of time, so I decided to do what every mildly geeky engineer would do: I quickly grabbed a bunch of never-before-combined parts out of my drawer, thinking <em>"this may work"</em>, and built my own improvised iPod car kit in a minute...

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>1 generic cellphone car charger with Mini-USB connector (such as one for Motorola phones)</li>
	<li>1 USB hub featuring a Mini-USB connector (supposed to go to the computer) and a bunch of regular ones (for the peripherals)</li>
	<li>1 regular iPod USB data cable</li>
	<li>1 audio tape adapter</li>
</ul>

Connect all pieces seemingly at random, stir thoroughly. Connect to your car and iPod. Notice the "charging" symbol show up on your iPod.

Listen to music and be happy ;)
