<strong>Ajax 13</strong>, a very young startup from San Diego, has developed an impressive collection of very, very sweet AJAX Office applications:

There are a write app as well as a spreadsheet tool which, if they want it to be successful, will surely have to try hard competing with Google's recently "hyped" <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Docs & Spreadsheets</a>.

However in addition to that they also have a <strong>presentation tool</strong> (ajaxPresents) that -- judging from my first impression -- looks and feels pretty much like the big standalone applications, Powerpoint and OpenOffice. It can also export and import these two file formats, which makes it a brilliant tool to edit presentation slides on a computer where you happen not to have an office suite installed.

But there are even two more on the list: A <strong>drawing tool</strong> called ajaxSketch (conveniently exportable to SVG) and an <strong>online MP3 player</strong> called ajaxTunes (if I see it right, it's Flash, not AJAX, but ah well).

<img id="image151" src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/writely_logo.png" alt="Writely logo" class="alignright" />All in all this seems to be a very interesting company to keep an eye on; and I would not be surprised if they made it on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Google">list</a> of <strong>Google acquisitions</strong> some time soon -- just like <a href="http://www.businessreviewonline.com/blog/archives/2006/03/writely_or_wron.html">Upstartle</a>, the company which produced the tool Writely, now part of the aforementioned Google Docs & Spreadsheets.
