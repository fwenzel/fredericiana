<a href='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/liquids-on-a-plane.jpg' title='Liquids on a Plane spoof'><img src='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/liquids-on-a-plane.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Liquids on a Plane spoof' class="alignright" align="right" vspace="20" /></a>The European Parliament in Strasbourg want the European Commission to <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/04/europe/EU-GEN-EU-Airport-Security.php">review the ban on liquids on European flights</a>:

<blockquote>EU parliamentarians are to vote on a resolution Wednesday calling on the EU executive to urgently review the restrictions, which have led to widespread confiscations, confusion and delays at airports.

"The European Parliament is concerned that the cost (of) the regulation may <strong>not be proportionate</strong> to the added value in terms of <strong>additional security</strong>," says the resolution, which is expected to be approved.</blockquote>

I hope the European Commission does relax the rules at least a little bit: The current ban on liquids on flights all over the world have, according to many <a href="http://www.schneier.com/interview-hawley.html">security experts</a>, while not increasing security significantly, caused much hassle and produced a great deal of cost for airlines and travelers. Apparently, <a href="http://www.zug.com/gab/index.cgi?func=view_thread&head=1&thread_id=74827">people who want to smuggle liquids, succeed</a>, and honest travelers like us get to throw away millions of bottles of water, with organizations outside the airport now <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/03/bottled-water-forbid.html">happily joining the paranoia</a>.

Easing the European travel regulations could take some time though: Each of the now 27 member countries of the European Union would have to approve.

Next step: Keeping our shoes on.
