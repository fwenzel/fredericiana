Today I am posting three photos is a row, as I got to take a photo a day, but not upload them the same day. It seems (gasp!), there are places with limited Internet connectivity left on the globe.

These are three "Switzerland" caps I saw in a store in the German-speaking part of the country. Wondering if something is a tourist gimmick or something any self-respecting local would wear? The fact that they feature the English spelling (in a country with four official languages, none of which is English) is a dead giveaway :)
