<img id="image83" src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/oscon-small.png" alt="OSCON Logo" class="alignright" />So, here we are at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/" target="_blank">OSCON 2006</a> in Portland, OR. The first day of booth action is over, all t-shirts have been handed out to people, and I already got to meet a lot of very nice and interesting people.

Even though OSCON is not the biggest free software conference in the world, it seems to be one of the most important ones.

We are having a blast here, talking to big business as well as community people, handing out a lot of coasters etc (want some? Come see us at booth 810!) and socializing with some of the finest people in the Open Source community.

Yesterday's Beerforge party (sponsored by the OSL, Jive Software and OTBC) in a fine bar here in Portland was a full success too. We really rocked the place and were having a lot of fun. Thanks for stepping by, all of you!

Tomorrow, the OSL is going to have an invitational event at its own facilities in Corvallis, OR where our friends and clients can take a look at our offices and data centers, chat about things and maybe pet their servers a little. I expect it to be a really exciting event too.

You see, that's how cool Open Source can be. If you are at OSCON, make sure you meet us at our booth. We'll be happy to meet you.
