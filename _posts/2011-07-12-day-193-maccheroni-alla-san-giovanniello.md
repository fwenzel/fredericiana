It's probably a pretty safe assumption that by now, 193 days into Project 365, I have driven away all readers who thoroughly dislike good food, so might as well proceed on the path of food madness!

This is fresh penne pasta with a "San Giovanniello" sauce that contains San Francisco-made prosciutto along with fresh, local, tomatoes, basil, and garlic. Mmmmmm.
