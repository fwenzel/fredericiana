My fellow Mozilla Webdev <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lonnen">Lonnen</a> made some <a href="http://instagr.am/p/Q1TVE/">fabulous campaign buttons</a> today for our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">favorite inventor of a popular web programming language</a>, just in case he ever wants to run for president.

<em>"Say what?"</em>

I anticipated you saying that, which is why I brought in a celebrity to illustrate my point:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/6265279536/" title="Day 292 - I Like Eich by Fredâ€‹, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6051/6265279536_9e55a3f245.jpg" width="402" height="500" alt="Day 292 - I Like Eich"/></a>

Get it?

<p class="credits">(Okay, here's your fine print: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>'s official picture may be in the public domain, but his passing predates the creation of JavaScript by a few decades which makes his support of Brendan Eich a slightly outrageous (read: not factual) statement. Though it obviously goes without saying that Ike would use Firefox if he were alive today.)</p>
