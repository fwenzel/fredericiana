The web comic Geek and Poke has hilariously determined how AIG accumulated a whopping 62 billion dollars in losses:

Of course, there's also a lot of other things that could have been done with the money---like paying off the national debts of China, Australia, Mexico <em>and</em> Ukraine... and 9 other things on a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/03/02/markets.whatlossbuys/">list CNN recently published</a>.

A friend of mine who worked at AIG before said <em>"of course I changed jobs as quickly as possible! Only a fool would still insure with AIG..."</em> ouch.
