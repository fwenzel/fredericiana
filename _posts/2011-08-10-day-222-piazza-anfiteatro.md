Not a picture I took today, but I didn't stitch it together until now, so I think it counts: This is a panorama shot of <strong>Piazza Anfiteatro</strong>, a market square in the city of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lucca">Lucca</a> in Tuscany, Italy. It was built in the 19th century on the ruins of an ancient Roman amphitheater.

If you like it, do look at the <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/freeed/6031343284/sizes/o/in/photostream/">full-size version</a>.

The picture is a panorama I stitched together from 16 different photos. When you look more closely, you can see that a man in the bottom left corner is missing a hand because he was present on one picture but not the other. I promise, however, that no Italians were harmed in the making of this picture.
