This is Tara, unwrapping my Christmas present to her: A framed original painting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_Bellecour">Place Bellecour</a>, Lyon, France. We got the painting well over a year ago when we last went there to visit, but never got around to having it framed (and, thus, never hung it up). Sneaky Fred snuck it out of the house and had it framed, (apparently) much to the delight of the Missus. Mission accomplished.
