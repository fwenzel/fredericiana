Today was the last day of (the conference part of) <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/">PyCon 2011</a>. Besides a few more talks (all of which have been recorded and are available online!), there was a poster session where various projects showed off their efforts. Like a science fair, except for geeks (wait, science fairs are already for geeks)...!

(It seems, back when most cameras sucked, one would get pictures with light leaked in, and/or instant film borders by necessity. Now that better technology has made this a thing of the past, people like me use software to put such quality flaws <em>back into</em> the picture. The irony is not lost on me.)
