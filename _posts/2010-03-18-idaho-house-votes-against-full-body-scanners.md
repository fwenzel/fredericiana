<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mmw_large.jpg"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/millimeter-wave-scanner.jpg" alt="" title="Millimeter Wave Scanner" width="250" height="145" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2643" /></a>A while ago, when I was flying to Idaho and had a layover in Salt Lake City, Utah, I was for the first time confronted with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter_wave_scanner">full-body scanners</a> at an airport security checkpoint. It was at the time a pilot test, and there were signs saying I had the right to refuse the scanner. Appalled by the idea of doing a digital strip dance for the security officers, I refused, and while I the security officer didn't appreciate the extra work, I had to wait in line shortly, received a quick pat-down, and was sent on my way.

Full-body scanners have since received a lot of attention, and were introduced <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/world/list-us-airports-full-body-scanners-2547541.html">in many airports</a>, some mandatory for primary screening, others opt-out, and finally some only use it for secondary screening, that is, when the metal detector beeps, or similar.

Today I am pleased to read that the Idaho House <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/boise/2010/mar/18/house-votes-against-full-body-scanners/">voted in favor of a bill</a> restricting the use of such scanners in the state (the bill would <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/hbo/2010/mar/13/hart-just-say-no-full-body-scanners/">forbid using such scanners as primary screening method</a> in airports). The bill is now moving to the Senate. While I may not agree with many views of American conservatives, (given I am European, probably not too shocking a statement), I agree with the assessment that full-body scanners entail an unreasonable strip search of people who haven't given any indication that would warrant such treatment.

Now let's hope the law passes, and that other states, and perhaps countries, follow suit.
