Kevin Rudd, who just became Prime Minister of Australia on Monday, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Rudd-becomes-PM-ratifies-Kyoto/2007/12/03/1196530513920.html">immediately got to work and just today ratified</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> (an amendment to the United Nations convention on climate change).

Now there is only one industry nation in the world left who did not formally commit to a common effort on climate change. You probably know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol#United_States">who it is</a>...
