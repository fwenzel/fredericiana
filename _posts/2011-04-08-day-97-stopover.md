Today I got sucked into a stopover at a local bar with a bunch of colleagues after work, after boldly proclaiming before that I'd head home early today, given how long the week had been so far. Oooops. At any rate, we had some very nice conversations -- having all/most colleagues in town for work week is always awesome!
