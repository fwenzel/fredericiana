<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">RememberTheMilk</a> is an online todo-list tool that I use to keep track of my everyday chores as well as, lately, the next steps I need to take for my master's thesis. (We are in the 21st centure, pencil and paper are overrated ;) )

Recently I took a look at their page's source code, and it seems, they have a <strong>Latin motto</strong>:

<img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/non-vi-sed-virtute.jpg" alt="" title="Non vi sed virtute, not armis sed arte paritur victoria" width="575" height="132" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1599" />

The Latin <em>"Non vi sed virtute, not armis sed arte paritur victoria"</em>, for my readers whose Latin is a little rusty, means <em>"Not by force but by virtue, not with arms but with art, victory is won."</em>

And thanks to a little digging I can even tell you the (probable) origin of this quote: According to an <a href="http://ansmagazine.com/summer07/liberty.html">article in the American Numismatic Society Magazine</a> (yup, coin collectors), the Latin quote appears in the <em>Sacrorum Emblematum Centuria Una</em> (Cambridge, 1592) of <em>Andrew Willet</em> (1562-1621), an Anglican divine who believed that reasoned argument was a tool superior to persecution in attempting to convert Catholics to the Church of England. This sentiment is encapsulated by the Latin motto.
