<a href="http://blog.jeanpierre.de/">Jean Pierre</a> recently showed me some photos of <b>Karlsruhe</b> on Flickr.<br />

What is so nice about these photos (unfortunately there are only two of them) is that it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe%2C_North_Dakota">Karlsruhe, <b>North Dakota</b></a>. As of the 2000 census, there live barely more than 100 people. "Our" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a> (having about 300.000 inhabitants) is marginally larger ;)<br />

Nice, small town, though. Unfortunately, its WP article doesn't tell us about whose idea it was to name it like that. What a pity. Does anyone know more?
