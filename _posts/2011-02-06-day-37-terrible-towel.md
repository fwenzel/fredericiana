Just in time for the Superbowl, I got my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrible_Towel">Terrible Towel</a> out of the last remaining moving box and decorated our television with it, before we had a bunch of friends over for the first Superbowl party we ever hosted.

Sadly enough, the Steelers didn't play well enough to win this time, but it was still fun!
