In response to yesterday's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE49217T20081003">vice presidential debate</a>, <a href="http://adennak.com/blog/wordpress/?p=92">Aden Renkai</a> came up with the following, fabulous litte flow chart that describes pretty well how it went down from Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's point of view--in fact, probably better than I could describe it with words... <em>"Darn right!"</em>

Critics say, she was doing pretty well, and it seems, her constant references to her family made a good impression too. However, considering the expectations towards her had been lowered to a mere "do no harm", her real merit was in not costing McCain the presidency on the spot. That makes it almost forgivable that instead of answering the moderator's questions, she went back to energy politics over and over again (we get it, you would like to drill for more American oil). Almost.

Biden (or O'Biden, as Palin called him once), on the other hand, didn't say many surprising things either, as he decided <em>not</em> to address Palin (not to lose "hockey moms'" votes across the country), and instead fought against his absent adversary McCain. More interesting than what he was saying though was his signature grin: I couldn't help but wonder, where did I see that before?

Later, it struck me: Joe Biden, much like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/">Ronald Reagan</a> a few decades earlier, was an actor before he entered the world of politics. His only, but famous role:

The winking Palin, by the way, led to a lot of amusement in the lecture hall I watched the debate in: It was grotesque that she behaved so similar to her Saturday Night Live parody (that has recently virally bubbled up on the internet):

The question is, who is whose parody? Palin - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey">Fey</a> or vice versa?
