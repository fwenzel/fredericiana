I am proud to report this is how I cut the plants in my "yard" -- though, really only the kinds of plants that can easily survive on their owns. The ones that need daily care have a tendency to die quickly under my "supervision" (and it's not even summer yet!)... so, sadly, the "green thumb" is sadly not a characteristic I can claim for myself.
