This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2_%28T1%29#T1">Volkswagen Type 2, 1st generation</a>, a pickup no less, that we saw in San Jose today. Reminds me of the Bug I saw <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/04/10/day-100-volkswagen-beetle/">a while ago</a>, but unlike that one, these light trucks were apparently not manufactured after 1967 anymore, so are increasingly rare. Very cool car!
