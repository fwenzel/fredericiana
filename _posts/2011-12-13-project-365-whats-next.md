With the end of <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2010/12/31/my-project-365/">Project 365</a> rapidly approaching (I'll blog about the project itself separately), the obvious question <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fwenzel/status/146433439212634113">arises</a>: <strong>What's next?</strong>

<img src="/media/wp/2011/12/fred-shadow-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="Fred Shadow" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4760" />As I can't quite get used to the project ending and me sitting bored on my hands all day (ha, ha) I am considering doing something similar next year. There are several (serious or not so serious) options on the table:

<ul>
	<li><em>Project 365, the rebirth:</em> Another year of photos? As if there's <em>anything</em> I haven't shown to my readers yet ;)</li>
	<li><em>American oddities:</em> Somewhat tongue-in-cheek, a friend suggested we need more stories <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/12/09/day-343-not-cut-from-the-same-cloth/">comparing US and German tissues</a>. There is, of course, plenty of opportunity to point out <del>inferior American products</del> <ins>cultural differences</ins>, though admittedly, that <em>has</em> been done before...</li>
	<li><em>Project 52:</em> (don't hate on the horrendous code name). In this case, I'd post a photo per <em>week</em> rather than day, giving me more time to take several shots in various places and decide which one I like the most, possibly polish it up on the computer, and post a photo a week that I think is actually pretty good.</li>
	<li><em>Project 360-365:</em> The frequency is to be debated, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dolske/status/146449816128462849">general idea</a> is, posting a series of panoramas. Daily is probably too frequent (after all, panoramas take some time to make) and it'd be a very limited type of photography, but it's still an option.</li>
	<li><em>A blog a day:</em> What the name says. A <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/raccettura/status/146437119957667840">new blog post every day</a>? That of course wouldn't exclude pictures, but would make it more about the writing than the picture. Project 365 was the other way around.</li>
	<li><strong>Anything else?</strong></li>
</ul>

These are all the ideas I've collected thus far. I am <strong>interested to hear what you think!</strong> Of course, not all of these make any sense at all, so feel free to mock them if you wish ;) but honest comments are appreciated, too. Thanks!
