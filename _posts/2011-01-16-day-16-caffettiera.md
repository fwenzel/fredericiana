As you <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/01/13/day-13-daily-espresso-routine/">now know</a>, I routinely have a cup of espresso after lunch, most days. At home, it currently looks like this: My 3-cup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_Express">Bialetti Moka</a> (or "caffettiera" as the Italians call it) simmering over a gas flame! Some of you may wonder, what happened to the full-blown espresso machine? It's hibernating: Due to the voltage difference between Europe and the US, I had to abandon my coffee <em>grinder</em> in Europe, and I have not yet acquired a new one. So while I have an espresso maker, I can't make properly ground coffee for it yet. But as soon as I do, rest assured you'll see a photo on in my "project 365".

Another 50mm portrait shot, plain and simple :)
