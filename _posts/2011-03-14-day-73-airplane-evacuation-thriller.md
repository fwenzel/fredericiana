This is a photo out of American Airlines' McDonnell Douglas MD-80 safety instructions. Besides the photo looking like it was taken in the 70s: <strong>Is this a scene from a Stephen King movie?</strong>

I mean, look at it. Estranged wife Alice here, evidently just pushed her husband Bob out of an airplane in an attempt to secure the house and cash in on the life insurance policy. To her dismay, there happened to be an evacuation slide where she thought stairs were awaiting. Bob, completely oblivious to this vicious ploy against him, just decides to enjoy the ride. <em>Woah, a slide! It is grey or yellow in color! Wheeeeeeeee!</em>
