Haven't posted new <a href="http://fredericiana.com/tag/failpet/">fail pets</a> in a while! Perhaps because this one took so long to arrive.

This "fail snail" was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ronin691/2634356788/">released by its creator</a> into the public domain and has since been <del>happily frolicking</del> <ins>coughing up <span style="background-color:#b6b6a3;color:#fff">HTML color codes</span></ins> on the Web. Though I haven't seen it used for an actual error page yet.
