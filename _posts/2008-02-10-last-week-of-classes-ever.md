Unbelievable: This coming week is my <strong>last week of classes</strong>, ever. It will be followed by an 8-week period of exams (with 1-2 weeks in between every two exams).

Then, provided I pass them all (which I like to hope), I will have done all requirements but my master's thesis in order to graduate from college with a degree in Information Engineering and Management.

I can't believe I am almost done studying -- it still feels like I've only started attending university just recently. Time flies, I guess.
