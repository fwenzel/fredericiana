When I recently watched a slideshow on flickr, I noticed this in the slideshow settings:

<img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/embiggen.jpg" alt="" title="Flickr: embiggen small things" width="340" height="179" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1464" />

It seems, flickr developers watch the Simpsons too. The word <strong>embiggen</strong>, along with <em>cromulent</em>, was introduced (read: made up) in the episode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_the_Iconoclast">"Lisa the Iconoclast"</a> and has since been widely used in popular culture. So widely even, that at least <em>cromulent</em> made it into <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cromulent">Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English</a> as a slang term.

Hm. Flickr is <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2007/07/01/ipernity-yay-flickr-nay/">re-gaining</a> some sympathy here (for this and other reasons I may soon blog about).
