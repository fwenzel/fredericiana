This weekend, I hooked up a Cisco Linksys E2000 router (upgrading from Wireless-G to 5Ghz Wireless-N). Sure enough, my laptop wouldn't consistently connect to it, so I ended up restructuring my network, and only after I installed DD-WRT on the new router did it become usable. I like the hackability of Linksys devices, but the preinstalled firmware is (and has always been) a piece of crap.

This is another pic taken at f/1.8, thus the low DOF. The white balance was highly messed up (apparently, none of the presets match my basement lights), so I fixed it after downloading the pic to the computer.
