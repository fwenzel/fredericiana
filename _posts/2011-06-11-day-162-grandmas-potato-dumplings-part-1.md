Oh hey, readers! Did I mention I like food?

This is the first step to my grandma's potato dumplings with pork roast and sauerkraut: The roast. It was supposed to be about 2 pounds of bone-in pork neck meat, but acquiring it was somehow challenging while <em>Dittmer's</em> in Mountain View is closed. So we went for the pork butt, at a massive 6 pounds, hah!

It's simmering with approximately a metric ton of cut-up onions (coincidentally a process made famous by Ray Charles with his performance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying_Time">Crying Time</a>).

Tomorrow, they'll join the star of the stage, the dumplings. Excitement ensues :)
