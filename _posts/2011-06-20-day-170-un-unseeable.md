I am sorry, but you cannot unsee this: My hotel's closet greeted me today with not one, but two, horrendous bath robes: One zebra print, one cheetah. After I regained consciousness, I took a photo and posted it to the <del>local support group for cheetah print victims</del> <ins>Internet</ins>, like any reasonable individual would. You're welcome.
