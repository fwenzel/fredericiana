<img src='/media/wp/2007/03/mozilla_mascot.png' alt='Mozilla Mascot' align="right" class="alignright" />I just stumbled across this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_company_name_etymologies">list of company name etymologies</a> on Wikipedia and noticed that <strong>Mozilla</strong> is also on there. It reads:

<blockquote>from the name of the web browser that preceded Netscape Navigator. When Marc Andreesen, co-founder of Netscape, created a browser to replace the Mosaic browser, it was internally named Mozilla (Mosaic-Killer, Godzilla) by Jamie Zawinski.</blockquote>

Mozilla, the <strong>Mosaic-Killer</strong>. Funny. (Even though I can't quite say much about the historical accuracy, of course).
