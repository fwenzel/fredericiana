<img src='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/googlemail-logo.gif' alt='Google Mail Logo' class="alignright" align="right" /><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/08/09/tech_is_google.html">Rumor has it</a>, GMail's storage may some day soon be cranked up to <strong>10 gigabyte</strong>.

That'd be sweet, for sure.

While I am really not (yet) in danger of hitting the limit (at the time of writing it's 2887 Megabytes), I still find myself deleting pictures etc. that I get by email if they are "too big" ever so often. Maybe I am too conservative there, but I still consider mails > 1 MB to be "big" and I tend to delete them if and when I can. It'd be nice if I had a reason to get more 21st-century-ish about it :)

I need to admit though, that GMail and most of its competitors are already beating accounts like my university email by far. I finally stopped using that one when I ran into its ridiculous 50 megabyte limit twice a month.

<strong>Update:</strong> It's <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-08-10-n90.html">Google's "Shared Storage" Program</a> that made people's GMail storage amount increase. Sadly, they increased the impressive one dollar price for 6 Gigabytes to 20 dollars just shortly after the program was started.
