Funny: According to <a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/cnn2.html">German news magazine tagesschau.de</a>, the CNN weather forecast still draws a <strong>thick border</strong> between the former German Democratic Republic and West Germany:

Of course, we really can't expect them to update their maps within 17 years after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification">major political event</a>.

The screenshot is an <em>actual screenshot from today</em>, but meanwhile, CNN has acknowledged the "recent" developments in world history and <a href="http://weather.edition.cnn.com/weather/maps.jsp?region=eu&mapview=forecast&x=16&y=14">removed the obsolete border</a>. Luckily, you can't zoom in any further -- otherwise we'd likely find the Berlin Wall intact and well-guarded ;) .
