These are some Northern Californian palm trees in the sunset. Coming from Germany (which, for reference, is about as far north on this planet as southern Canada), palm trees still have an exotic feel to me. Guess I haven't gotten used to the Californian climate yet?

This is the first black-and-white picture in my Project 365. As with all effects, it's better not to overdo it. But I found B&W appropriate for this one, as the sun coming from the front essentially made the palm trees look like a stencil on the bright background.
