Update on the unlucky rock slide story: Apparently it's going to be <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/07/30/bc-porteau-cove-rockslide-reaction.html">closed for five days</a>, meaning we have to leave much earlier in order to take an alternative route to Vancouver.

I can't exactly say I am looking forward to spending 7 instead of 3 hours in the bus :( At least I am not flying back straight to Pittsburgh on Friday, so at least it won't be followed by another 8 hours or so of traveling.

<strong>Update:</strong> My bus was rescheduled to 3 am in the morning. Looks like I'm not going to go to bed that night and just sleep on the bus.

<strong>Update 2:</strong> Thank heaven somebody filed a bug on this: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=448604">Can't get out of Whistler</a> -- can't be long until this gets fixed!
