With my discount card for young people from the French train system, sometimes buying train tickets leads to strange results: This time, because second class tickets were almost sold out (and I was unable to get anything more than a 25% rebate), <strong>first class tickets</strong> actually turned out to be <strong>cheaper</strong>:

So I will soon be able to give the first class seats in the latest-generation French TGV trains a shot. If you twist my arm, I <em>guess</em> I can resort to this kind of traveling ;)

This will of course only happen if they figure out <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL1910661620071119">their <del>little</del> <ins>major</ins> strike problem</a> soon over there. We'll see.
