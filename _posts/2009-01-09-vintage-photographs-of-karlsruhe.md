Searching for "Karlsruhe" on Amazon.com, I found a few sellers that reprint old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochrom">photochrom</a> (sic) photographs from the collection of the Library of Congress. Among them, these three beautiful old photos of my university city <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe (Baden)</a>, dated somewhere around the turn of the last century:

<img src="/media/wp/2009/01/karlsruhe-general-view.jpg" alt="Karlsruhe: General View" title="Karlsruhe: General View" width="500" height="388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924" />
First, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Karlsruhe-general-Germany-photochrom-photochrome/dp/B001ENDBQC/">"General View of Karlsruhe"</a> as seen from the residence castle, facing south.

<img src="/media/wp/2009/01/karlsruhe-stadtgartensee.jpg" alt="Karlsruhe: Stadtgartensee" title="Karlsruhe: Stadtgartensee" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1925" />
This one, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/public-Karlsruhe-Germany-photochrom-photochrome/dp/B001ENWNFM/">"Lake in Public Garden"</a> shows the <em>Stadtgartensee</em>, which is now inside the Karlsruhe Zoo.

<img src="/media/wp/2009/01/karlsruhe-vierortsbad.jpg" alt="Karlsruhe: Vierordtbad" title="Karlsruhe: Vierordtbad" width="400" height="318" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1926" />
At last, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pavilion-Vierortsbad-Karlsruhe-Germany-Library/dp/B000QT7NH8/">Vierordtbad</a> -- a public, in-door pool, that's been built in the 1870s. Completely renovated in the early aughts, it has now as "young" a look as ever. (Side note: The picture title is, incorrectly, "Vierortsbad" = "four city bath", but it was actually called after a gentleman named "Vierordt" who donated some 40&nbsp;% of the original building costs back in the day).

Very nice photos! But, while this makes the city look "old", Karlsruhe is actually quite the kid, compared to other German cities. It was not founded until 1715, when the Margrave of Baden-Durlach decided to build a new residence -- and a nice little city to go with it.
