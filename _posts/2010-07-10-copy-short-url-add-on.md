<strong>Update:</strong> The add-on is now on AMO! <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/197224/">Check it out!</a> Also, feedback is greatly appreciated!
<hr />

This week during the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2010">Mozilla Summit</a> in Whistler, British Columbia, there was a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2010/Rocket_Your_Firefox">"Rocket Your Firefox"</a> <a href="http://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/">Jetpack</a> contest: The idea, make a new add-on using the Jetpack SDK, submit it, win a prize.

So I went ahead and made a jetpack called "Copy Short URL" and it does what it sounds like:

<blockquote>On any webpage, you get a new item in the right click menu called "copy short URL". When you click it, the add-on looks for a canonical short URL exposed in the page header. Currently, a number of major websites expose their own short URLs for any entry on their webpages, among these: youtube ("youtu.be/..."), flickr ("flic.kr/..."), Arstechnica, Techcrunch, and many more.

If, however, the site does not name its own short URL, the add-on automatically falls back to making a short URL using tinyurl.com.

Either way, after a fraction of a second, you end up with a short URL in your clipboard, ready to be used in forum posts, tweets, or wherever else you please.</blockquote>

My add-on won the contest in the "most useful" category. The prize was an awesome jetpack sweatshirt:

If you want to check out the add-on, it is currently available (open source, of course) on the <a href="https://builder.mozillalabs.com/addons/by/112675/">add-ons builder website</a>. I also uploaded the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/197224/">add-on</a> to AMO.

Hope you find it useful!
