I just read a press statement from the German federal statistical office, pointing out the most significant price changes in November 2008, as compared to the same month a year earlier:

Good news for us geeks: Personal computers are, still, one of the products whose prices drop the most drastically these days. Of course, why the cucumber prices also dropped or the ones of butter (reminds me of the constant over-production of butter in the EU since the 1970s, satirically dubbed <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterberg" hreflang="de">"Butterberg"</a> = "butter mountain"), I don't know. It is also not particularly pleasant that the prices of vegetable oil and "pulses" (which, as my dictionary told me, are <em>legumes</em>) are on the rise, at least until Apple reveals the new <em>edible iPod</em>, or course.

So much for the day from the department of things you never wanted to know ;)
