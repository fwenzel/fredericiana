Not to be confused with a donut box (although that'd be so much tastier), this <strong>"donot box"</strong> nicely describes <a href="https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/media/logos/#mozilla-common-mistakes">what <em>not</em> to do to the Firefox logo</a> -- namely printing it on a strongly colored background. Presumably, the box once contained these exact stickers, but now we're all out. Sadface.

Now, if it eases your pain, and while we're at it, treat yourself to some music from the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/donots">Donots</a>, one of my favorite German punk rock bands (singing in English, for what it's worth). You're welcome.
