Oh no! Yesterday was the first day in 85 days of "Project 365" that I failed to take and post a picture that same day. I blame <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>: During the day I was busy, but usually catch up on the photo taking before the end of day. But then I gave Minecraft a shot: It's a fantastic little game about converting a world made of blocks into something awesome (and all the while staying safe from the monsters that come out at night). I like the gameplay and how--in this xbox and PS3-saturated world of ours--it's a game that totally pulls off the 8-bit graphics.

Apologies for the delayed post and I'll try to be on top of it again (unless I get sucked into the game agai.........
