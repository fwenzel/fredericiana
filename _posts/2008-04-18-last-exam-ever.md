Just to give you a piece of unwanted knowledge, I just passed my last exam ever! It was about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">parallel programming</a>, by the way.

Now it's really <em>only</em> my <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/03/15/masters-thesis-planned/">masters thesis</a> that stands between me and graduation. Yay!
