may I have your attention for a second. As the founder of the <em>task force agains the shameless raping of coffee products</em>, I demand to abolish and forbid by law the so-called <em>Espresso Americano</em>.

Putting two shots of Espresso into a 12oz cup and filling it up with hot water is just cruel :(

Thanks for feeling with me ;)
