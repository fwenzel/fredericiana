Just found a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Panda">red panda</a> pic that works as a desktop wallpaper:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meantux/1025248778/"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/redpanda.jpg" alt="" title="Red Panda" width="500" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1521" /></a>
