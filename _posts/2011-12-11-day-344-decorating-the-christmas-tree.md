As promised, we decorated our <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/12/07/day-341-christmas-tree/">Christmas tree</a> today! This is me, admiring my reflection while the Missus is focused on putting some more ornaments on the tree. Heh!

(This is the part when my visitors are relieved that I wore pants while decorating, I know).
