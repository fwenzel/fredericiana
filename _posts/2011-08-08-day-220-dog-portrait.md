On the lookout for trouble? Perhaps!

I find pet portraits in low-light situations really, really hard. Obviously the subject won't hold still even for a second. So we get to crank up the ISO (hello, graininess) and pick a large aperture at the expense of depth-of-field and sharpness. That's why my success rate on such portraits is probably 20% at best, but luckily project 365 is a photo a day, not ten!
