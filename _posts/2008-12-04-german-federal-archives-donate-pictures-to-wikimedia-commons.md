The <a href="http://www.bundesarchiv.de/" hreflang="de">German Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv)</a> are <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Bundesarchiv">donating about 100,000 pictures to the Wikimedia Commons</a>, all under a Creative Commons 3.0 by-sa (Germany) license. From the wiki page:

<blockquote>Starting on Thursday Dec 4, 2008, Wikimedia Commons will witness a massive upload of new images. We are anticipating about 100,000 files from a donation from the German Federal Archive. These images are mostly related to the history of Germany (including the German Democratic Republic) and are part of a cooperation between Wikimedia Germany and the Federal Archive.</blockquote>
(...)
<blockquote>To our knowledge the donation of 100,000 images is single largest one to Wikimedia Commons so far and we are very hopeful that this is only the start of a long lasting relationship that might serve as an example to other archives and image databases.</blockquote>

As noted <a href="http://www.uninformation.org/weblog/122" hreflang="de">elsewhere</a>, in Germany this almost counts as the <em>"hell freezing over"</em>: When it comes to availability of historic documents created by the government, Germany has so far had a lot to be desired.

Among the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_the_German_Federal_Archive">photos uploaded so far</a> by the import script are already some nice little gems of German history, for example:
<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-09061-0002,_Berlin,_Greifswalder_Stra%C3%9Fe,_Feierabend.jpg"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/bundesarchiv-berlin-feierabend.jpg" alt="" title="Bundesarchiv: Berlin, Feierabend" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1858" /></a>
<em>"Feierabend"</em>, or <em>"calling it a day"</em> in the GDR. The slogan at the gate reads: "100% of our staff oppose re-militarization" (one and a half years later the East German government proclaimed the need for a new national army and founded it another four years later, in 1956) and on the factory wall: <em>"FÃ¼nfjahrplan -- Friedensplan"</em>, or <em>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Year_Plans_for_the_National_Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union">Five-Year Plan</a> -- Peace Plan"</em>.

How about this one:
<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Bundesarchiv_Bild_173-1282,_Berlin,_Brandenburger_Tor,_Wasserwerfer.jpg"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/bundesarchiv-wasserwerfer-brandenburger-tor.jpg" alt="" title="Bundesarchiv: Wasserwerfer am Brandenburger Tor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1859" /></a>
Water cannon at the border between east and west berlin, right at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate">Brandenburg Gate</a> (note its pillars in the background), only a stone's throw away from the modern-day German national parliament building. The sign reads: "Warning! You are now leaving West Berlin!" -- a similar sign can still be seen at the historic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie">"Checkpoint Charlie"</a>.
