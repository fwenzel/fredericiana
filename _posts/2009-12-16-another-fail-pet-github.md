Here's another, beautiful specimen in <a href="http://fredericiana.com/tag/failpet/">my little collection</a> of what I have called "fail pets" for awhile now: <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>.

<a href="/media/wp/2009/12/github-fail-unicorn.JPG"><img src="/media/wp/2009/12/github-fail-unicorn-477x400.jpg" alt="Github Fail-Unicorn" title="Github Fail-Unicorn" width="477" height="400" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2513" /></a>

I wonder if their <strong>pink fail-unicorn</strong> is somehow related to the similarly colored (but less angry) <a href="http://djangopony.com/">Django Pony</a>. A distant relative, maybe -- especially since the "original" Django pony was, in fact, a <a href="http://twothirty.am/blog/2009/10/07/blessing-mythical-django-pony/">unicorn</a>.
