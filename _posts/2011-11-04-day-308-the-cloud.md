<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">"The Cloud"</a> is all the rage now in the Silicon Valley. Quite appropriately, this building in downtown Mountain View reflects the (real) clouds very nicely. I also like how the architectural style that looks a lot like the windows on an airplane.

Credit for the "photographer's eye" goes to <a href="http://morgamic.com/">morgamic</a>, who pointed out the photo opportunity while I was oblivious. Thanks!
