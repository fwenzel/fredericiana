The nutcracker is just hanging out on the tree, eagerly waiting for Christmas morning (or rather, Christmas Eve, when us Germans open their presents). I like nutcrackers (even the bigger kind whose mouth actually opens) -- though ironically, they are completely useless for their actual job, and I have yet to see one that wouldn't break if you tried cracking a hazelnut or walnut with it...
