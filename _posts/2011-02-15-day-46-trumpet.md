Today, after a long time, I picked my trumpet back up and practiced a little -- woot! At the office after hours, no less, since I was in the neighborhood anyway. I am happy to report it worked well: My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embouchure">embouchure</a> is hosed, but that was expected. As I found out later, there were still two of my colleagues around, and they didn't seem to have suffered bodily harm, so all is well.
