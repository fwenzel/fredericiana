This or something like this is what hungry Mozillians see after their weekly meeting: Monday's on-site lunch. Today, we had <em>Mediterranean</em> food. To me in good ol' Europe that term always meant Italian or Greek or so, but over here, it seems to mean middle eastern food. Well, they are all in the general vicinity of the Mediterranean, that's for sure :) The wraps and other delicacies were pretty excellent either way.
