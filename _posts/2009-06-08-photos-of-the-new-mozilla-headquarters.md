Today, Mozilla Corporation moved into new headquarters, across town, in Mountain View, California. The new place, which I have only seen as a building site so far, is bound to be awesome, judging by the photos that are slowly showing up on the web.

These and more photos are available on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deb-richardson/sets/72157619365961813/">Deb Richardson's flickr feed</a> (thanks, Deb!):
