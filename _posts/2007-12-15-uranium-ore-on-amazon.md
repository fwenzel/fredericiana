Apparently, you can (legally) buy cans of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000796XXM/">Uranium Ore</a> on Amazon.

Still looking for a Christmas Present?

Is it just me, or is that really a little strange to buy something like this off the internet? But then again, the same seller also offers <em>Rosswell soil samples</em>, so what can you expect.

One of the customer reviews with two out of five stars is really funny:

<blockquote>I bought a can of this <strong>about 4.5 billion years</strong> ago, give or take a few million years, but when I went to use it today I noticed <strong>only half of it was still in the can</strong>. I swear I put the lid on tight. I'd give it more stars if it came in a better package.</blockquote>

Oh, sweet science! :)
