If you ever wanted to know how hard we are actually working here at Mozilla, just take a look at the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Special:Statistics">MozillaWiki Statistics</a> page.

At the time of writing, it says there are <strong>18,446,744,073,709,551,054</strong> pages that are "probably legitimate content pages":

<a class="imagelink" href="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/mozillawiki-statistics.png" title="Mozillawiki Statistics on 1-19-07"><img id="image159" src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/mozillawiki-statistics.png" alt="Mozillawiki Statistics on 1-19-07" width="400" class="center" /></a>

That's roughly 18 and a half <strong>quintillion</strong> pages. Happy reading! ;)

PS: It's obviously extremely unlikely that this is a mistake. The internet doesn't lie, after all.

<strong>Update:</strong> This was filed as a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367573">bug</a> and fixed now, which reduced the number to a boring 260... That still sounds wrong (there have to be more than that) but it's slightly closer to reality, for sure :)
