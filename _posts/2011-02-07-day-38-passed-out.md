Today, Lizzy spent almost an entire day at the vet, getting a full checkup, various vaccinations, the works. Apparently it was an exhausting endeavor in doggy land, which is why she is com-plete-ly passed out now. Aaaaaaw!

<strong>Update</strong>, Feb 8: After a good night's sleep, Doggie is back in the land of the wagging and the home of the barking. Excellent!
