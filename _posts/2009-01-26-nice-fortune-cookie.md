I find it highly ironic and amusing that <strong>a fortune cookie</strong>--of all things man-made, yes, the same kind of fortune cookie that has been "sticking its nose" in other people's business ever since its inception--dumps its opinion about <em>talking of things you don't understand</em> on me.

But I guess it's better than this one of unknown origin (which has been floating around on the internet for about a million years and is most likely photoshopped):

(Yeah, I played with iPhoto there to give the photo up there the look it has now -- a simple pic looked too boring.)
