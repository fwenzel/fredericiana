Today, the <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> team came to Mozilla HQ to give a presentation about the project and its comparison with CPython. The title of this particular slide, "Python is Complicated", sounded like a good overall headline for the topic to me.

Thanks to the PyPy team for stepping by. This was an excellent warmup for <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/">PyCon</a>!
