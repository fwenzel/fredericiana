Wow. I just unsubscribed from a <strong>Barnes and Noble</strong> promotion mailing list (that I didn't even subscribe to in the first place...) and they literally ask for <strong>10 business days</strong> to unsubscribe me from the list:

If they delivered their books as "fast" as they manage their mailing lists they'd probably have lost all their customers by now...
