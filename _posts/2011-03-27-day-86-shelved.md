Today, at last, I got around to re-building my garage shelves, so my tools finally have a proper "home". It turned out to be a project of the kind <em>"assemble IKEA stuff without instructions and with some parts missing"</em>, but the results were good. Though the angle brackets to connect the shelves to the wall were MIA, I used different ones that I had on hand, with screws I happened to have around. The majority of the weight is carried by the shelves' L-feet anyway -- I am quite sure I wouldn't want to trust an American-style drywall to carry any serious weight ;).
