title: Bye bye Wordpress, Welcome Jekyll!
---

Feel free to blame it on [@cupofT](http://twitter.com/cupofT)'s excellent homebrew that I happen to be drinking right now, but I decided it was time to blow the thick layer of dust off my blog that it had accumulated over the years.

Wait, no wordpress anymore?
---------------------------
I know, crazy, right. This blog has been powered by Wordpress for several years now and it's been serving me well. Plenty of features and plugins for all my blogging needs, great spam protection, etc.

Just, it's too complex. I don't use half of Wordpress' features, and the source code of most wordpress blogs (mine included) looks like a web design agency exploded. Good source code reads like a poem, not like the phonebook of Manhattan.

Plus, being in the business of bleeding-edge web development does not mix well with the cruft of a years-old wordpress instance. What *does* mix well is generating your blog out of a git repository and publishing it on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com)!
