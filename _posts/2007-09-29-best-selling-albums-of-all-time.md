<img src='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/gramophone.thumbnail.jpg' alt='A Gramophone; source: sxc.hu' class="alignright" align="right" />Our beloved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America">RIAA</a> is usually up to no good, but they have an interesting list of the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100">100 best selling albums of all times</a>:

Place #1 goes to the <strong>Eagles' Greatest Hits</strong> (which surprises me a little bit), followed by Michael Jackson's <strong>Thriller</strong> and Pink Floyd's <strong>The Wall</strong>.

Makes for a nice iTunes shopping list (with an interesting mixture of all genres, for obvious reasons).
