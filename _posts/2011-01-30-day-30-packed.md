As a German abroad, I take pleasure in being able to buy things on Sundays -- especially after I spent some time living in Bavaria, the state with the strictest <em>shop closing laws</em> in all of Germany. (If you care: Stores in Bavaria must close at 8pm Monday through Saturday, and on Sundays stores are closed in all of Germany by federal law).

So I decided to do a home improvement project (semi-voluntarily), and took the car to the friendly home improvement store at the mall, just to find out that <em>going to the mall on a Sunday</em> wasn't exactly an original idea. After 10 minutes of looking for a parking spot, I gave up and instead walked to the store, so I ended up carrying the somewhat unhandy materials I bought home by hand. Sunday workout, check.
