Here it is:

my very own weblog :)

It's <a href="http://www.s9y.org" title="http://www.s9y.org" onmouseover="window.status='http://www.s9y.org';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';return true;">serendipity</a>-driven and the first one I ever had... so please forgive the mistakes I may make from time to time ;)

One word concerning the language: I will blog in german or english - depending on my mood and whether I think an english reader may be interested in it!

All right? So let's start it all with a nice quote:

<blockquote>The purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas, obscure pure reasoning, and inhibit clarity.<br />With a little practice, writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog!<br /><div align="right">Calvin <em>from &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;</em></div></blockquote>
