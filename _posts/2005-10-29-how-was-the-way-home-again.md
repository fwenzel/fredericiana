How was it again, the way home when I was in Germany? Aaaah I remember!

Markus just sent me a picture message from his cellphone in the tram. Woohoo! How fancy the green-yellow pattern on the seats is ;)

Thanks for reminding me of the <em>45 min journey</em> that I have to take to university in Germany <em>every day</em>. Oh, and, thanks for reminding me of the <em>other 45 minutes</em> it takes me <em>to get back home</em> again.

Okay, this belongs to the things I do not miss here. However, the "bike riding action" here is somehow flawed by the rain getting you soaking wet easily... Everything has its drawbacks.
