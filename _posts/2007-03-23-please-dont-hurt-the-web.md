I really like this recent Mozilla poster:

<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/wiki-images/en/c/c6/Moz_ffx_openStandards_1680x1050.jpg"><img src='/media/wp/2007/03/mozilla-openstandards.jpg' alt='Mozilla: DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hurt the web' /></a>

(As far as I know) it first came up as a concept (see below) at the Firefox on-site meeting in Mountain View in November 2006, and because it's pretty irresistibly cute, we really couldn't let it catch dust in a drawer :)

<a href="http://fligtar.com">Fligtar</a> caught the presentation slide at the Firefox summit:

<a href="http://fligtar.com/gallery/v/fx2summit/DSC00683.JPG.html"><img src='/media/wp/2007/03/donthurt-concept.JPG' alt='DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hurt the web, concept' /></a>

Good job, Dave and the rest of the marketing team!
