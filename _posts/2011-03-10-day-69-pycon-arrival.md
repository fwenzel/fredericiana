Today, I was traveling to PyCon, a Python Open Source conference. I was thinking about posting a photo of traveling to the conference (I have a lot of photos showing planes and such), but then I stuck with the community. This is a photo of the first place I visited when I met new people I didn't know before PyCon. A brewery in downtown Atlanta.

We talked a lot about web applications, security, etc. It was fun! :)
