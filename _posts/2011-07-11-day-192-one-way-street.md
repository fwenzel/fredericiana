Starbucks, fueling the throw-away society since 1971.

Now, don't get me wrong, I like my cappuccino as much as the next guy, but it greatly saddens me just how much trash your average to-go coffee place actually produces. The semi-proudly presented recycling subtext on the cups ("contains 10% post-consumer recycled fiber" or so) provides little consolation in the light of, well, 90% fresh tree (along with a plastic lid) being dropped into the nearest to-the-landfill trash can after a mere 15 minutes of caffeination.
