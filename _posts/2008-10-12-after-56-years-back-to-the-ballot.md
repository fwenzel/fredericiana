There's a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7665925.stm">106-year-old American nun living in Rome who plans on voting this year again</a> for the first time after she voted Eisenhower in 1952:

<blockquote>Sister Cecilia Gaudette, who last voted for President Eisenhower in 1952, has registered to vote and says she will vote for Democrat Barack Obama.

Although hard of hearing, she keeps herself informed by reading newspapers and watching TV (...).

Asked about her hopes for the US under an Obama presidency, she says: "Peace abroad. (...)"</blockquote>

She could well be the oldest person to vote in that election. I find it impressive how much she still cares about politics, at an age few will ever reach.
