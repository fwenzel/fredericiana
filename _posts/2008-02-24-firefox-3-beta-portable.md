Ah, for those of you who have wanted to try out the latest Firefox 3 Beta all along but were hesitant because they feared it screwing with their local data (current profile etc.):

<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable/test">PortableApps offer the Firefox 3 beta</a> as a USB-stick-ready package that won't touch anything on your local computer, making it safe and fun to try out for anyone who's feeling curious:

<blockquote>Mozilla FirefoxÂ®, Portable Edition is available packaged with Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 3, allowing you to test all the latest features in the upcoming version without disrupting your current Firefox installation.</blockquote>

Have fun beta-testing!
