In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/world/europe/08germany.html?_r=1&amp;emc=tnt&amp;tntemail1=y">New York Times article</a> about the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago, they add a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2009/11/06/world/08berlinwallgrfxB-ready.html">schema of a typical section of the German-German border</a>, showing that the "Wall" was not really only a wall, but rather an elaborate combination of measures to keep people from fleeing their own country. Pretty impressive and sad at the same time.
