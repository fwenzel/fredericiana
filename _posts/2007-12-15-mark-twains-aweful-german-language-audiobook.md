<a href="http://librivox.org">Librivox</a>.org, a public domain audiobook project, has a copy of Mark Twain's fabulous essay <strong>"The Aweful German Language"</strong> in which he pleasurably depicts the pitfalls and oddities of the German language. The summary reads:

<blockquote>If you’ve ever studied German (and maybe even if you haven’t), you’re likely to find this short essay to be hilarious. Published as Appendix D from Twain’s 1880 book A Tramp Abroad, this comedic gem outlines the pitfalls one will encounter when trying to wrap one’s mind around the torturous German cases, adjective endings, noun genders, and verb placement.
(Summary by Kara)</blockquote>

Incidentally, the audiobook is read by a German, which adds to its hilarity. (And I hereby admit to probably having a similar accent, so yeah...)

By the way: Don't take the poor Mark Twain too literally. German really isn't that bad! :)
