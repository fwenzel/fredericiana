A little technical side note:

On Thanksgiving, <strong>November 27 between 5am and 7am UTC</strong> our server host will perform <strong>upgrades on their network infrastructure</strong>, leaving this website (and all other domain names and services associated with its server) <strong>unavailable</strong> for probably about <strong>half an hour</strong>.

Sorry in advance for the inconvenience.

You should be sleeping at the time anyway ;)
