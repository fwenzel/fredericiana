I've been making a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme">memes</a> lately, mostly for the fabulous <a href="http://mozillamemes.tumblr.com/">Mozilla Memes</a> tumblr site. Now, not all of the silly ideas I come up with are Mozilla-related, so naturally, I should publish my memes here for your general entertainment!

So today, I had the "sobering" realization that the <a href="http://rubygems.org/">ruby gems</a> I bought from a trustworthy gentleman on the Internet recently* might not be as valuable as expected:

I knew it!
