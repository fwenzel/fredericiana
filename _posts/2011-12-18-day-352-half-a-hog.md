Take a look at our recently-acquired half a pig, wrapped in subtle white paper packaging, spending its days in subzero (Celsius, anyway) darkness until it is consumed. There are various fine things in there that I am eager to eat: Bacon, obviously, but also various different roasts and cuts that are just waiting to be turned into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnitzel">Schnitzel</a>.

Nom nom nom.
