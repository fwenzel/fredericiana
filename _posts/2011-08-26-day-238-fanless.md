After my old desktop computer started getting crashy and happily heated up the room by just being on, I started looking for more economical (and ecological) alternatives and went for this mini-board with an AMD processor and no fan (ooo!). It has a dual-core CPU with 1.6GHz, and now sports a whopping 8GB of RAM. Finally, I also got a new power supply, because the years-old 550W thing I had in there was probably about as energy-efficient as your average Chevrolet Suburban.

I can do something on my computer for longer than 20 minutes without it crashing <em>and</em> be nice to my power bill? Win!

Granted, I probably can't play any serious games with it, but I don't do that anyway.
