Say hi to <strong>Mozilla's new Firefox costume!</strong> I think it turned out great! Our <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/03/16/day-75-headless/">old costume</a> served us well, but this one will looks much friendlier and even has a fiery tail (that <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/thunder">Thunder</a> has clearly taken a liking in).

I am looking forward to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mart3ll/status/147855463667597313">hearing more about the design process</a> that made this happen!
