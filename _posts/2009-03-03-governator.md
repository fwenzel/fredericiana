I can't believe Arnold Schwarzenegger closed his <a href="http://www.crn.com/it-channel/215600349">opening address for the Cebit 2009 expo in Hannover, Germany</a> with both of his catch phrases: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasta_la_vista,_baby_(quote)">"Hasta la vista, baby"</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll_be_back">"I'll be back"</a>.

In related news, I noticed the now-politician still walks like the "Terminator". Here I was thinking it was all an act, but apparently it just comes naturally to him.

That's all, folks---now <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/quotes">get to the chopper!</a>
