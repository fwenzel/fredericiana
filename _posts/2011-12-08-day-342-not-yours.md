Thanks to a carefully wordsmithed warning message, the <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/12/05/day-339-mushroom-people-hefeweizen/">Mushroom People Hefeweizen</a> survived three days in a shared fridge at work (a new record) and was consumed today.

I must say, this was some fine, fine brew. Beeradvocate <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1878/49114">agrees</a>. (On a side note, sometimes I think about getting an account there and write about my beer tasting experience, but I fear that neither would my palate be able to detect all the notes people routinely point out in their reports, nor would my vocabulary suffice for the colorful descriptions used therein. Sadface.)
