After I posted about <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/01/03/fred-08-schwag/">Fred campaign merchandise</a> recently, I was pointed to the "home and garden" section on Amazon, which apparently has a lovely collection of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&search-alias=garden&field-brandtextbin=Fred">Fred-related merchandise</a>!

Of course I want most of these things (did I mention I will add them to my wish list) and probably "need" none of them :) .

Except for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fred-Toothpick-Holder-Ouch-Gray/dp/B000HKHAHY/">Fred "ouch" toothpick holder</a>, maybe (which would make for a nice voodoo doll, too!):
