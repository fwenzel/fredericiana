There's been a nice little meme going on in the <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org">Mozilla blogosphere</a> during this last week: Running your blog through the <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">wordle "word cloud" generator</a>, then posting it. Here is mine:

<a href="/media/wp/2008/12/wordle-fredericiana.jpg"><img src="/media/wp/2008/12/wordle-fredericiana-575x298.jpg" alt="Wordle on fredericiana" title="Wordle on fredericiana" width="575" height="298" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1870" /></a>

Comes to no surprise that "German" and "Germany" are two of the most-used words here -- I sure hope I am not boring my readership to death by giving them intercultural lessons here :)

Anyway, if you post yours, feel free to send a ping to this article, or leave a comment with the link to your blog. I am looking forward to seeing how others' <em>word clouds</em> look!
