Today, I am mo-blogging from Oregon State University, while I am here for work and "turkey week" reasons.

I came across this neat poster for the <a href="http://osel.oregonstate.edu/">Open Source Education Lab</a> featuring the <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Projects/Firefox/Firefox_Circle">Firefox Crop Circle</a>. (The OSU LUG, in case you didn't know, were the people who made that famous crop circle last summer, <ins datetime="2006-12-01T21:47:51+00:00">realizing an idea by the two former Mozilla interns Matt Shichtman and John Cary</ins>!)
