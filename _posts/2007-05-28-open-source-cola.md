<img src='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/opencola.jpg' alt='OpenCola' class="alignright" align="right" />WikiHow has a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-OpenCola">howto for making "OpenCola"</a>, a soft drink with a GNU GPL licensed recipe.

The main ingredient is -- <em>how surprising</em> -- sugar:

<blockquote>When you make cola, you basically end up filling a glass with sugar and then adding just enough water and ancillary ingredients to get it to dissolve.</blockquote>

I have to admit this doesn't really make me want to try it out -- even though I realize that there's probably just as much sugar in commercial pop.

Sometimes I am plain impressed with how we can seriously drink that stuff.
