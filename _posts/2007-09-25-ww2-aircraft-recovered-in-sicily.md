Off the mediterranean coast of Sicily, Italy, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F4U_Corsair">F4U Corsair</a> aircraft was recently recovered. The plane had gone down in an unknown location at the time (yet not as a result of combat, they say) and was now found when it got caught in a fishing net (nice alternative to tuna, for sure).

Here's some coverage I saw on AFN Europe:
