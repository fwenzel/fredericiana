This is a tiny little coffee roaster on display at Dana Street Coffee in Mountain View. Dana Street is a locally-owned local coffee roaster that I enjoy going to much more than the omnipresent Starbucks. For their excellent coffee as much as their hand-drawn signs everywhere. And besides this little roaster, they also have a full-blown one (with an exhaust through the ceiling), right in the middle of the place, next to all the tables and plenty of coffee bags. Very charming.

The roaster itself is apparently an <em>AJ Deer Company "Royal No. 4"</em> coffee roaster, could well be over a hundred years old. You can guess what kind of gem this is when you see that a (restored) one of these roasters was on sale <a href="http://www.coffeeforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=20532">here</a> for almost 10,000 dollars. Awesome!
