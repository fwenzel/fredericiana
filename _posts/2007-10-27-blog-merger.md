A while ago, I <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2007/07/12/blog-fusion/">asked my German readership</a> if they would mind me merging my German and English blog together. For time reasons, my blog output wasn't as high as would be reasonable to fill two blogs with, and furthermore, I often had trouble deciding if I wanted to blog something in my English or rather my German blog.

<img src='/media/wp/2007/10/merge-sign.jpg' alt='Merge Sign' class="alignright" align="right" />Fact is, most of my German readers can read English (and don't mind doing so either), while the opposite does not apply.

The German readers (and the English-speaking ones who also understand German) said they wouldn't mind, and encouraged me to do so.

Yet, until now, I didn't find the time to <em>actually do it</em>. Today, I finally merged my two blogs into one, (of course not entirely without problems, I'll blog that in a little while too), and to cut a long story short: Here are the changes that count for you, dear readers:
<ol>
	<li>fredericiana.de is now part of <strong>fredericiana.com</strong> -- all requests to .de get <em>automatically redirected</em> to the appropriate .com site.</li>
	<li>If you have subscribed to the German feed, please update your feed reader (even if the redirect works fine for now, I can't guarantee that fredericiana.de will <em>always</em> stay a straight redirect to the .com site).</li>
	<li>If you have subscribed to a specific category only, please adjust your feed URL also.</li>
	<li>If you cannot or do not want to read one of the two languages, I suggest you filter by the German or English category on the right hand side, respectively (especially when using a feed reader!). Then you should not see the stories anymore in the language you don't want.</li>
</ol>

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any comments, or if you notice any unexpected behavior, or whatever else you may have for me, please do not hesitate to leave a comment. Thanks!
