<a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/fredw/2179796"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/walking-to-the-sky-small.jpg" alt="" title="Walking to the Sky" width="180" height="240" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1816" /></a>CMU's newspaper "The Tartan" has an article about <a href="http://www.thetartan.org/2008/11/10/news/tuition">Carnegie Mellon University's tuition being the 11th highest in the nation</a>:

<blockquote>Tuition is on the rise, according to a new College Board list citing Carnegie Mellon as having the 11th highest tuition in the U.S.

(...)

Tuition costs are not the only concern for prospective students. Ranked 11th as the college with the highest tuition, Carnegie Mellon is also ranked 11th by the College Board for the highest total cost. Factoring in room and board, the estimated total cost for the 2008â€“2009 year is $49,200 according to the College Board website.</blockquote>

That is even higher than the so-called "Ivy League" schools:

<blockquote>Interestingly, the Ivy League schools were not featured on either list in a ranking higher than Carnegie Mellon. Neither Harvard, Yale, Stanford, nor the University of Pennsylvania were listed in the top 25 highest tuition or total costs. Harvard placed as the 118th most expensive college in tuition and 108th in total cost.</blockquote>

Will these people be able to pay off their college loans before they retire?
