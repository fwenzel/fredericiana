This is quite interesting to see, how California's as strong as France and Texas as Canada, for example. (However <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2007/01/countries_gdp_a.html#c27798765">elsewhere</a> people suggested that the raw GDP doesn't say much and per capita GDP would be a better comparison).

Some might wonder why Germany's not on the list: It's because its GDP is higher than any single US state.
