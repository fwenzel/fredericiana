Today I worked Mozilla's part of the fight against SOPA, the <em>Stop Online Piracy Act</em>: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/sopa">mozilla.org/sopa</a>.

What is SOPA, you might ask? It's a law intending to establish the <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">first American Internet censorship system</a>. Tomorrow, 11/16, Congress holds hearings on this bill, and the scary thing is: This bill can pass. If it does, the Internet and free speech will never be the same.

Because of the fundamental danger SOPA poses to the civil rights and the core principles of the open Web, Mozilla is joining other leading Internet companies, public interest groups and citizens in opposing the Stop Online Piracy Act in the US House of Representatives. For more information, head over to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/sopa">mozilla.org/sopa</a> and join Mozilla in helping protect the Internet as we know it.
