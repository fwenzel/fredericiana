In one of the other offices here in the same building as Mozilla headquarters, one can see this desk from the outside. I kid you not, this is a 1998 book on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-COM-Applications-Internet-Explorer/dp/0130819093">Building COM Applications with Internet Explorer</a>. It makes me smile everytime I walk by. Of course, one would hope this person does not actually use this as a daily reference -- but given that the book stands next to what I believe is an <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> logo, it is probably meant as a joke. Well played!

This is probably by far the worst-quality photo I have had in my project 365 so far (do <em>not</em> look at it at full size), and I apologize. But the subject was just too good to pass up on.
