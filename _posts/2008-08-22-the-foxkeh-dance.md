Today was the last day at Mozilla for <a href="http://alex.polvi.net/2008/08/07/polvinext/">Alex Polvi</a>, web ninja and one of my favorite colleagues at the <a href="http://osuosl.org">OSU Open Source Lab</a> and later at <a href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a>.

But it wouldn't be our Alex if he didn't leave with a bang, so he made a <a href="http://foxkehdance.com/">"Hampster Dance" style website named "Foxkeh Dance"</a>, featuring the cute Japanese Firefox mascot "Foxkeh" and celebrating <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2008/03/31/10-years-of-mozilla/">10 years of Mozilla</a> along with 10 years of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hampster_Dance">Hampster Dance</a>:

I just warn you, if you're like me, you'll have trouble getting that catchy tune out of your head for the rest of the day -- much like the first time when you looked at Hampster dance back in the 90s.

Take care, Alex, and I hope our paths will cross again sooner rather than later!
