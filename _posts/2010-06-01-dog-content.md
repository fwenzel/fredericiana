On occasion, people claim I blog about too much geekery, so here you go with some dog content:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/sets/72157624180107030/"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/lizzy-chicken.jpg" alt="" title="Lizzy with Chicken" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2743" /></a>

Yup, that's Lizzy, playing with her brand-new rubber chicken. She picked it herself at the store and oh-so-appropriately, it is a Bavarian chicken sporting Lederhosen.

Given her usual aversion to having photos taken of her, I was impressed that I got a set of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/sets/72157624180107030/">four pictures</a> before she bailed.
