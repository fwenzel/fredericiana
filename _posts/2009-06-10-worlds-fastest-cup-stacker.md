He's 11 years old, and the world's fastest cup stacker. He made this <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2009/06/08/fastest-firefox-part-2-more-speediness/">"Fastest Firefox" video</a> for the upcoming Firefox 3.5 launch. Of course Firefox can't stack cups, but its new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine is also one of the fastest in the world!
