Since my daily blog reading is more than you would want to visit "by hand", I use a news reader. For a long time I used the online newsreader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines">Bloglines</a>, but recently (after a kind recommendation by <a href="http://blog.jeanpierre.de">Jean Pierre</a>) I switched to <a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html">Vienna</a>.

The effect is the same: The software gladly collects any changes to publishers' RSS feeds and stores/caches them locally for me to read.

Every once in a while you get articles twice, mainly because an author changed something shortly after they hit the "publish" button. This happened on bloglines a lot, apparently because blog software already pings update services and bloglines seemed to pull the respective feed immediately.

The <a href="http://bbc.co.uk">BBC</a> frequently pushes headlines out that it reviews minutes later, sometimes it's just horribly wrong English, sometimes it gives you a wrong impression of what was happening.

Today they <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/entertainment/6148132.stm">write</a>:

<blockquote><strong>Spanish master's Children stolen</strong></blockquote>

and the concerned reader thinks, <strong>kidnapping, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zomg">ZOMG</a>!</strong>

But then, seconds later, the writer decides to replace the headline in question by a less horrifying 

<blockquote><strong>Goya masterpiece stolen</strong></blockquote>

I wonder... - in the internet century, don't people think twice before publishing anymore?
