Time to revisit <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/03/21/day-80-almost-springtime/">Day 80's photo</a>: No blooms, just plenty of fallen leaves and (what feels like) freezing temperatures. Brrr. Now, I realize that at <abbr title="59 degrees Fahrenheit">15&nbsp;degrees (Celsius)</abbr>, this isn't really as cold as I make it sound, but this is California, isn't it supposed to be warmer? ;)
