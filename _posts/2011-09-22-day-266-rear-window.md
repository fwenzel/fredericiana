<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047396/">Hitchcock</a> would be proud of this photo, I think. The neighbor's tiny little back yard has developed into somewhat of a landfill here (more so than your average American two-car garage that forces the owner to actually park the car in front of it). On the upside, it almost never rains in Northern California, so he is apparently confident enough to put uncovered, electric appliances out there as well. Not a bid I'd want to take, but perhaps he's winning in Vegas all the time and now wants to branch out.
