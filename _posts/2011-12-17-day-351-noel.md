Today's science experience was: Does a Christmas stocking holder survive unharmed when dropped off the mantle? Sad answer: It does not. Despite the state-of-the-art glue and toxic lead paint holding it in place, the "gift" on the top broke off and had to be fixed. Quality made in China just isn't what it used to be anymore ;)
