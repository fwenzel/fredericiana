<em>As always, what I am writing here is my own opinion and not a statement on behalf of Mozilla Corporation.</em>

When I was just visiting Wikipedia, I was greeted with this temporary error note (which, luckily, does not happen too often in spite of Wikipedia's huge popularity):

And, even if this marks me as a Web 2.0 geek, I must admit: All I was thinking was -- <em>where's the pet?</em>

The first company to put a recognizable, even likable, "pet" onto their error pages was likely Twitter. And due to the horribly frequent outages associated with Twitter's "growing pain", we got to see the <del>little</del><ins>huge</ins> fellow quite often. In the mean time, he seems to have swam away, at least I haven't seen him in awhile. Yet, he's not forgotten: the fail whale even has <a href="http://failwhale.com/">his own fanclub</a>.

Another place where I saw a "fail pet" was yelp, whose error page was sporting a picture of an actual dog, apparently the company puppy "Darwin" (sorry for the tiny screenshot):

<strong>Now where's yours, Wikipedia?</strong>

Of course, considering I so provocatively ask this question, you might respond: <em>Well, where's yours, Mozilla?</em>

Here at Mozilla, we are not particularly proud of software failures, because unlike your regular web 2.0 start-up (think Twitter) where every service failure means more customers than anticipated, failures in Mozilla-land usually mean a crashed browser, (possibly) lost data and certainly frowning users<sup>*)</sup>. So when the <em>Crash Reporter</em> icon was redesigned, we could have gone ahead and hired <a href="http://www.foxkeh.com/">Foxkeh</a> as our "crash mascot", but that would do the poor little fox wrong -- and at any rate, we prefer associating mascots with good stuff here at Mozilla. So at the time, user experience engineer Alex Faaborg made sure we don't create <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2008/09/27/new-crash-reporter-icon/">something too memorable</a>, for example nothing like a second <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death">"Blue Screen of Death"</a>. Of course, had Microsoft known at the time how appeasing error messages can become with a little help from the animal kingdom, they'd have hired the entire cast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes">Looney Tunes</a> to show up in their dreaded error messages.

But this might well be one of the few things we have in common with Microsoft: No fail-pets for us, any time soon.

<sup>*)</sup> On a side note, although it won't make a user fell better whose browser just crashed: When Firefox crashes it is most often due to binary, third-party plug-ins like Flash, Acrobat etc., and not due to a bug in Mozilla software -- as evidenced by the publicly available <a href="http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/query/query?product=Firefox&version=ALL%3AALL&date=&range_value=1&range_unit=weeks&query_search=signature&query_type=exact&query=&do_query=1">"top crashes" list</a> and the bugs associated with it.
