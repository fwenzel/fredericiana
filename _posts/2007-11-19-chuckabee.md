I know what you're thinking now: <em>"Where can I vote for Chuck, and who's that other guy in the commercial anyway?"</em> (after all, you American voters have made an actor president before, and the Californians have made one governor, so this seems to be the logical career step for American actors). Maybe next time he'll have a heart and roundhouse kick his way to the Oval Office?
