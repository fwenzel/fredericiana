Today we went to the <a href="http://www.sjfm.com/">San Jose Flee Market</a>. It is <em>huge</em>. They offer everything from clothes over tools, kitchen supplies, to shoes and even auto parts. Even better, there's a fairly big farmers' market in the middle of it. Besides fruit and veggies, they also sell candy and the piñatas to fill with it. Very fun place to spend a Sunday afternoon!
