Dear readers!

I wish you a <strong>merry Christmas and a good and successful year 2008</strong>. I hope you had fun reading my blog this year and thank you all for your helpful comments and constructive input. I hope you'll still bear with me for a long time to come!

Now get back to your Christmas feasts but make sure to not drink and sing (instead, always choose a designated singer!), or you may end up like this guy: ;-)

(The song being so graciously interpreted here, by the way, is a German Christmas song that goes <em>"silent, silent, silent, because the child wants to sleep..."</em>)
