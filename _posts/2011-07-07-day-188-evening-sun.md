Today, my new fisheye lens arrived, and it seems it's capable of some fabulous pictures! This is today's sun, a few minutes before sunset. Note the nicely bent lines that are straight in real life...

The lens is actually fully manual, making it somewhat challenging to use, but I wouldn't have a photo project if I wasn't looking for a challenge ;)
