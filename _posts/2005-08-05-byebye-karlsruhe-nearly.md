Okay, things are getting clearer now: Next month IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll leave Germany for <a href="http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/">Corvallis</a> (precisely, to <a href="http://www.oregonstate.edu">OSU</a>) and wave Karlsruhe farewell for quite a long time, then.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, by the way, I have bought a <b>bike</b> in Corvallis. Yes, you read well ;) IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have it put in a "safe place" until I get there to fetch it. Yeah.<br />
