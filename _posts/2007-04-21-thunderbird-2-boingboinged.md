<img src='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/thunderbird2.jpg' alt='Thunderbird 2 Artwork' align="right" class="alignright" />The newly released Thunderbird 2 was promptly <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/04/19/thunderbird_2_is_out.html">BoingBoinged</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> calls Thunderbird <em>"free, kick-ass email"</em> and shows that Thunderbird is the best mailer out there, for the average and not-so-average mail user:

<blockquote>I send several hundred emails a day and receive at least a thousand non-spams every day. I need an <strong>industrial-strength mailer</strong>, and I get it from Thunderbird. <strong>I love it.</strong></blockquote>

Thanks to Cory for the nice review and thumbs up to the Thunderbird team for their latest and greatest release :)
