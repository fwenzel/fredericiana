The tail fins (or "vertical stabilizers" as they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_stabilizer">apparently</a> correctly called) of two Lufthansa airplanes at Frankfurt International Airport.

Side note: The reflections in the window and the ugly advertisement make me sad a little, but other than that, I still thought this made for a good shot.
