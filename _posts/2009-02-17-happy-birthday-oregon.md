This past valentine's day a few days ago was not only even cheesier than last year's (on the radio, they were making up a "Valentine's Eve" on the 13th already -- how long until Valentine's week, month or year emerge?), it was also the <strong>150th birthday of the State of Oregon</strong>. If I had to choose what American state I'd like to be a Citizen of, Oregon would rank pretty high on the list.

Just in time for the big one-five-oh, <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2009/02/14/happy-150th-birthday-oregon/">Oregon State University's archives joined the flickr commons</a>, publishing some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/">nice photos</a> from the state's past for everybody to enjoy. I am delighted! Needless to say, the pictures are in the public domain (or so they <a href="http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/archives/FlickrCommonsNoKnownCopyrightsRestrictions.html">assume</a>).

Before the OSU Archives joined the "commons" project, they had already added <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/osuarchives/">another flickr account</a> on their owns, publishing other gems from their vault, such as these <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/osuarchives/sets/72157609294932130/">great, historic football programs</a>:
