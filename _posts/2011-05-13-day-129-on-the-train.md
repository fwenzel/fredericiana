My wife Tara looking out the window on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV">TGV train</a> in the German countryside.

I like this picture a lot: There's the reflection in the window, as well as the partial profile on the left, and of course the mildly blurry countryside in the background. Cool!
