Yesterday, I registered with <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and sent out a few invitations to people I know who also have an account.

Sadly enough, LinkedIn didn't like my name, FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric, quite as much as I do, so the invitation emails ended up being signed like this:

<blockquote>I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.

-<strong>Fr&amp;#xe9;d&amp;#xe9;ric</strong></blockquote>

I reported the bug and hope they fix it soon. For now, I replaced my "ÃƒÂ©"s by regular "e"s but of course they are only half as nice :)

Sorry for the inconvenience to everyone who though <em>"who the heck is that?"</em> when receiving my email.

<em>(Thanks to Brandon and morgamic who told me about the problem.)</em>
