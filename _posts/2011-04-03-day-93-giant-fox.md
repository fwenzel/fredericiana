Today, a bunch of Mozillians made a trip to <a href="http://www.cagreatamerica.com/">Great America</a>. The rides were sooo much fun! And then, at some ring-throwing game, Dustin scored and got a giant fox. In the picture: Les, pretending to be <a href="http://potch.me/19/he">the CEO of <del>Firefox</del> <ins>Mozilla</ins></a>.
