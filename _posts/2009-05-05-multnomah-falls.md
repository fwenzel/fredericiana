Browsing through the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/">Oregon State University Archives on Flickr</a>, I found this cool <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3387946758/">1940 photo of Multnomah Falls</a>, by the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3387946758/sizes/l/"><img src="/media/wp/2009/05/multnomahfalls.jpg" alt="Multnomah Falls" title="Multnomah Falls" width="400" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2204" /></a>

I totally dig the old American cars, and the overall "family day trip" vibe. Also, I just love the color of this Kodachrome color picture.

The falls, by the way, were still as gorgeous as they are in this picture when I went there <em>65 years later</em>.
