If Jesus lived today, maybe he wouldn't be a carpenter. Maybe he would be a web designer. Or a sysadmin. One thing is certain, he'd use Linux.

And because modern Christians know that, they made a web page with the nice name <a href="http://whatwouldjesusdownload.com">whatwouldjesusdownload.com</a>, hosting the <a href="http://www.christianubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Christian Edition</a>. What else can a proud churchgoer want?

Besides, of course, a Christian game console. Since we all know, Jesus saves.

He illustrates bible stories with pictures from LEGO figures, making them actually really exciting to read, even for people who are not into church -- the page reads itself like a comic book.
