This is how facebook greets me this morning:

<img src='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/german-facebook.jpg' alt='Facebook in German' />

<blockquote>Welcome to Facebook in German... Now German speakers all over the world can join.</blockquote>

I am not sure if I have the heart to switch it to German though: It just "feels wrong". And after all, I think it'd result in a horrible mixture of English and German, wouldn't it?
