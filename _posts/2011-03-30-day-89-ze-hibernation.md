Today, I had a quick appointment at Mercedes Benz Research and Development in Palo Alto, and this is what I was greeted with in the parking lot: (Presumably) research vehicles, hibernating in a protective "sock". Considering the tree branches on top of the left one, looks like the cars haven't been moved in a while. Still, they look pretty cool, with their star on the front, as if they want to say, make no mistake, this sock puppet has a German accent. :)
