For the most part, I like the new iPhone/iPod app store: There are a lot of applications on there that could turn out to be very useful.

Others however are kind of weird, such as <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284963359&mt=8">"hold on!"</a>:

<img src="/media/wp/2008/07/app-store-hold-on.jpg" alt="" title="iTunes App Store: Hold On" width="319" height="248" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1336" />

<em>"Compete to see how long you can hold the button!"</em> -- riiight, so how did this end up in the <strong>productivity</strong> section exactly? Ah: <em>"Develop your perseverance and improve your concentration skills to make you more productive!"</em>

Well, at least it's free ;)
