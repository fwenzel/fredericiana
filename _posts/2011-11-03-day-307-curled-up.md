As you might have noticed, I post pictures of my dog when I haven't had time to take a picture during the day.

Today's picture is an HDR shot made from a single RAW image, which is something I always wanted to try. Seems to have worked well, but when you zoom in, it also brings out a lot of the graininess from the low-light conditions. By the way, to tonemap the shot, I used a new web tool I discovered: <a href="http://www.simplycontrast.com/">SimplyContrast</a>.
