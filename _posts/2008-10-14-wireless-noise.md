<a href="http://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon's</a> wireless network makes me sad: I get about <strong>20 KB/s of constant noise</strong> (all day, every day) from, mostly, Windows computers announcing their presence to the outside world via broadcast packets.

In the "network" window, this looks like that:

If this is a secret ploy with the intention to empty everybody's laptop batteries as fast as possible, it's working! :) Then again, unlike University of Karlsruhe, CMU puts power outlets into every seat when they drop a bucket of money to renovate a lecture hall. At my home university--with the exception of the new library--laptops have to be mostly powered with their owners' <em>love and respect</em>: Places with appropriate power connections are rare.
