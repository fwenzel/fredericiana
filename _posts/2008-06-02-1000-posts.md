<em>We are interrupting our program for a shameless plug for... ourselves:</em>

Wow, some time during my last few posts on this blog I crossed the <strong>1000 post</strong> mark :)

<img src="/media/wp/2008/06/1000.jpg" alt="" title="1000" width="338" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1290" />

This means, since its opening in early 2004, this blog has entertained (or bored, which I hope not) you with some 20 posts a month on average. Not bad, is it?

(I need to admit, lately it's been a little less than that, but very soon I should have more to talk about again :) )

All right, so much for the shameless plug. Now, carry on.
