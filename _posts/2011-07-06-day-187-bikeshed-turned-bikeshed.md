Part of Mozilla's conference rooms are named after Internet memes (did I mention we are nerds?). So, besides rooms like <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dancing-baby">"Dancing Baby"</a>, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/win">"Win"</a>, and <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us">"All Your Base"</a>, we also have "Bikeshed", a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_Law_of_Triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a> (as Wikipedia helpfully suggests).

Appropriately, this room has been consistently used to park bikes for quite some time now. So this week, it was turned into an <em>actual</em> bikeshed. Out with table and screen, in with bike racks. Nice!
