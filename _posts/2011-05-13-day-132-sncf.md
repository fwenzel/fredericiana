Corail are the "slow" variant of French long-distance trains, as opposed to the famous TGV ("Train à Grande Vitesse", meaning high-speed train). On the route between Strasbourg, Alsace, and Lyon, Rhone-Alpes, however, both kinds take the same time due to the old age of the tracks. There's hope though: By the end of the year, a new high-speed connection between the two cities is going to be opened, improving travel times significantly.
