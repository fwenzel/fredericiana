Gotta love Amazon recommendations. Apparently, it found out due to my viewing history, that I am interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_stems">stem vowels</a>:

What they did not explain is how the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/belgium.shtml">Belgium</a> they came up with that (I know for a fact that I did not search for that), and more importantly, how it is even possible to develop an <em>interest in stem vowels</em>.

Then again, I am not a linguist, so maybe I am just an utter philistine when it comes to the beauty of stem vowels. Who knows?
