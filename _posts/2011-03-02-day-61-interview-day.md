I spent a substantial part of this week (and today in particular) interviewing applicants for various positions in the general vicinity of myself in the organization. It's a lot of work, but it was also a lot of fun talking to some of them who brought some really interesting experience to the table and I hope I will get to work with them soon.

If you think you should be one of my colleagues here at Mozilla, <a href="http://mozilla.com/careers">check out our jobs page and apply</a>!

(Yes, this is a close-up of the actual questions I used today. The attentive among you now know that I ask some general questions that have something to do with Mozilla during my interviews. Surprised? I hope not!)
