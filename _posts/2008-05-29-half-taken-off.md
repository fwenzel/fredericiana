<img src="/media/wp/2008/05/pittsburgh-wikipedia.jpg" alt="Pittsburgh (source: Wikipedia.org)" title="Pittsburgh" width="250" height="166" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1286" />My take-off to Pittsburgh is coming closer and closer, and in the meantime, my to-do list seems to be getting longer and longer, but I am bravely fighting through it :).

What's kind of weird is the <strong>housing situation in Pittsburgh</strong>: I've been writing emails to a bunch of landlord and landladies that I found on craigslist, but most people want to rent out their rooms for a 12 months lease, minimum, and 9 months is not acceptable.

Others just want me to send a check from a distance, rather than making an appointment to look at the place. Riiight. I am going to give you money just like that.

The last group posts quite appealing ads with descriptions of how their apartment is, what the room to be rented is like, how conveniently it's located, etc etc, and once you reach the end of the ad, it say <em>"females only"</em>. Noooo...

In spite of these little problems, I am looking forward to go to Pittsburgh soon. I'm sure it'll be fun.
