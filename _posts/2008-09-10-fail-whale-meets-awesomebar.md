As I signed up for <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> during a period of <em>"high maintenance"</em> (that's polite for <em>almost-constant brokenness</em>), I encountered the <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/07/03/tweeeeet/">fail whale</a> quite often---and learned to like it, in its own way, because it had become a tradition of sorts, like <a href="http://help.com/post/124066-funny-metaphors-used-in-high-school">fathers chasing kids around with power tools</a>.

How nice: Nostalgia 2.0.
