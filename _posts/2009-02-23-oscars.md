The <a href="http://www.oscar.com/">Oscars</a> are over again and a movie named <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/movies/awardsseason/23oscar.html">"slumdog millionaire" won a whopping 8 of them</a>. Now, I've never heard of this movie before. Seems to me like it was buried in the ridiculous amount of advertisement for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1114740/">"mall cop"</a> -- a painfully cheesy flick that I did not want to see in the first place and whose overdone ads everywhere made me want to watch it even less.

Also, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/">"Slumdog Millionaire"</a> is going to premiere in Germany mid-March only, well after its release date in the US, and obviously after the Oscars as well. I thought the times when movies are released in Germany later than the US were finally over? Guess not.
