The <a href="http://osuosl.org">Open Source Lab</a> at <a href="http://oregonstate.edu">OSU</a> now (proudly) <a href="http://osuosl.org/news_folder/kernelosl">hosts the kernel master server</a>.

When I got a tour through the OSL facilities on friday, I had the opportunity to take a sneak peek at the world's most important server (okay I'm exagerating...). Actually it isn't too fancy to look at at all, no blinking lights, no LCD display (as most of the other servers have it), no, just a tiny black box mounted to its rack of choice.

However, if you want to see some photos of the "historic event", <a href="https://osuosl.org/photos/kernel">go ahead</a>.
