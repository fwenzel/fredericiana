This is a statue I saw in downtown San Jose. It's made in 1986 and is called <em>Secrets</em>. Now, I am European and used to naked statues everywhere, but I couldn't help but think: If this was Arkansas, would there be a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/26/arkansas-supermarket.html">"family shield"</a> on this thing?
