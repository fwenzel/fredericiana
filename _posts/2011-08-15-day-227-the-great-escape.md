Some parts of Mozilla's Mountain View headquarters looked like this today, after the <em>Great Escape of 2011</em> took place last Friday -- when a bunch of Mozillians packed their bags and set sail to the new Mozilla San Francisco office -- leaving behind what will be more room for awesome new hires!

The concept of people working remotely (usually from their own homes) is not new to Mozilla. In fact, far more than half of our employees do not work out of the Mountain View headquarters. Though we have plenty of ways to stay in touch: emails, wikis, and of course our all-time favorites <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla</a> and <a href="http://irc.mozilla.org/">IRC</a>. In addition, we have <a href="http://air.mozilla.com/">Air Mozilla</a> (our video streaming site) and, most recently, a video conferencing system. So there's little reason to worry that our new San Francisco remoties will drop off the face of the earth.
