Looks like I was right holding off on the new MacBook Pros for a while: A huge part of the users apparently experiences problems with the <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/02/macbook-no-button-trackpads-not-registering-clicks/">"no button" trackpad not registering clicks</a>:

<blockquote>A tip came in this weekend from someone with a fleet of new MacBooks. His complaint? Every 50 or so clicks and the trackpad freezes for 5 to 10 clicks and then wakes back up.</blockquote>

The users in the comments over at CrunchGear also note that  the click of the new "button-less" trackpad is considerably louder than the previous versions' button, which is why some of them have switched on "finger-tap" clicking (incidentally a feature that I <em>disabled</em> on my laptop because it mistook my moving the mouse as a click too often). Maybe it's a case of nostalgia: Dear younger generation, this may be news to you, but keyboards always used to have an audible "click" sound whenever you pressed a button (and I can't believe that's how old I am already ;) ).

Let's see how long it takes for the first hardware and software fixes to be released. And for <a href="http://blog.jeanpierre.de/2007/12/29/what-is-it-with-apple-macbooks-and-their-batteries/">old times' sake</a>, when will the first battery factory recall be?
