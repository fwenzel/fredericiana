<blockquote class="magazinequote">"Quick, put the disco music on, he's having a heart attack!"</blockquote>U.S. doctors have found the Bee Gees 1977 disco anthem "Stayin' Alive" provides an <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/odd/news/usnTRE49F869.html">ideal beat to follow while performing chest compressions as part of CPR on a heart attack victim</a>.

<blockquote>The American Heart Association calls for chest compressions to be given at a rate of 100 per minute in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). "Stayin' Alive" almost perfectly matches that, with 103 beats per minute.</blockquote>

The study left the open if wearing the appropriate attire is also beneficial for the patient's survival.
