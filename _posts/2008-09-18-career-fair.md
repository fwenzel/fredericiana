Just coming back from a <strong>career fair</strong> at CMU's University Center, where I went to say hi to the people who manned the Mozilla booth. As I hadn't come to engage in recruiting discussions, I neither carried a resume binder under my arm, nor was I dressed in a black suit like every other person who went there.

Quite amusingly, while the students dressed up in order to show off their seriousness, all of the recruiters were dressed casually in t-shirts or polo shirts and jeans in order to show how relaxed they were. Funny sight.

Lucky as I am, I also got a USB stick from the Cisco booth (thanks Rob for giving me yours, since you got the last one!)... It has 1GB, that'll make for a great new root drive for my <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2005/12/16/nslu2-linux-usb-harddrive-spindown/">Slug</a> (which currently runs on 512M). By the way, why can OS&nbsp;X's Disk&nbsp;Util.app <em>format</em> an <tt>ext2</tt> partition, but OS&nbsp;X can't mount or read it? Very odd.

Oh, and just in case anyone was wondering how high the percentage of international students at CMU is:
