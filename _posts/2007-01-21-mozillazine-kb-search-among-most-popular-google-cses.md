<img id="image163" src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/mozillazine.png" alt="MozillaZine zeppelin" class="alignright" />The <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/">mozillaZine</a> knowledge base uses a Google <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=003258325049489668794%3Aru2dpahviq8">Custom Search Engine</a> so people find what they are looking for.

And as you can see on <a href="http://google.com/coop/cse/examples/Popular">Google CSE's "most popular" list</a>, it's currently the <strong>number 3 most popular</strong> custom search engine there is (provided, of course, their list is actually sorted).

Not bad, mozillaZine people, not bad! :)
