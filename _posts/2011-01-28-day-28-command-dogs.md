This is a sign on an industrial facility around here. Looks like is has suffered under the hard, Northern Californian winter (wait, what?) quite a bit. Of course, that doesn't exactly explain what <em>command dogs</em> are (Google is of little help) and how they differ from regular <em>guard dogs</em>. Oh, and what about when they are <em>off duty</em>? Questions, questions.
