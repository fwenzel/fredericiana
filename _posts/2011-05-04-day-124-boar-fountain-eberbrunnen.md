This is the landmark of my home village: The boar fountain. Built in 1992, it honors the history of the town as a farming village. Once upon a time, the farmers took their pigs to the nearby forest to have them feast on the acorns, earning the locals the nickname "the boars".

Unsurprisingly, farming has since receded in importance, and most residents are white-collar workers commuting to the nearby bigger cities now. The affectionate nickname, however, stuck.
