<b>Welcome to fredericiana.com</b>.<br />
<br />
This is not my first blog entry, even though it looks alike. In fact, I am a German blogger already writing his <a href="http://fredericiana.de">sententia fredericiana</a> for about a year now.<br />
<br />
But now, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about time to <a href="http://fredericiana.de/archives/2005/06/13/alles-fredericiana-oder-was/">start blogging</a> in English also. Why? Mostly, because IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going to study in the U.S. for a year soon. And then IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll probably (hmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ okay, letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s say <i>hopefully</i>, instead) get some new readers that wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to speak German. Also, writing English gets easier when you do it more often - as it is with all foreign languages, I suppose.<br />
<br />
At last, I hope you will enjoy reading this blog as much as I just did when starting it. And donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be shy - add the RSS feed to your feed reader. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t regret! :)
