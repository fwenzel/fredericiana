Meet <a href="http://ryansnyder.me/">Ryan</a> and <a href="http://davedash.com/">Dave</a>. They work with me on the <a href="http://input.mozilla.com">Firefox Input</a> project, and this is what spring cleaning looks like. We are working through a number of maintenance bugs to get our <a href="http://github.com/fwenzel/reporter">code base</a> ready for the challenges of Firefox 4 and beyond. Busy times!

By the way, our code is Open Source, and <a href="http://github.com/fwenzel/reporter">can be forked on github</a>.
