Computers are, as we all know, there to do jobs us humans just can't be bothered with, such as thinking, or noticing the obvious. I am therefore glad that the travel website Orbitz reminded me today that my air travel itinerary contains (*gasp!*) flights.

Thanks, Orbitz. If it wasn't for this friendly heads-up of yours, I would have almost accidentally <em>walked</em>.
