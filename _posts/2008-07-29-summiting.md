Well, greetings from Whistler, BC! It's raining, but sessions have started so we don't really hang out too much outside at the moment anyway. And while meals are outside, they are luckily in a tent. Phew.

Of course at lunch, I was stirring the salad dressing and promptly a round piece of glass at the bottom of the jar <strong>broke out</strong> and decided to flood my pants with what I believe was yummy while still in the jar. Always good to have a pair of spare pants.

I added some pictures to ipernity already, so <a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/14835/album/76805">go over there if you'd like to see what I took pictures of</a>. I also wrote some code to import ipernity into <a href="http://summit.mozilla.org">summit.mozilla.org</a>, where I hope it'll show up soon.
