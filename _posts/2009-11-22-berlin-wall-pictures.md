Just in time for the recent 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/11/the_berlin_wall_20_years_gone.html">boston.com's Big Picture</a> has a great collection of photos -- both contemporary and recent -- that show what the Wall once looked like, and how it looks now. This is great!
