We all know, getting <em>into</em> your university of choice can be quite hard. But, who knew getting <em>out</em> of one (properly) is almost equally as complicated?

<img src="/media/wp/2009/03/bundesarchiv_b_145_bild-f023862-0009_karlsruhe_technische_hochschule-300x226.jpg" alt="Universität Karlsruhe" title="Universität Karlsruhe" width="300" height="226" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2097" />I am telling you, the university wants to see how much I can suffer, one last time. By sending me across campus multiple times to acquire signatures and pick up forms. And stand in line (first to pick up the form, then to fill it out, then to hand it in, then to pick up the signature). And by telling me that they decided to close their office on Mondays. And Fridays. And to open it between 10 and 12 only, the rest of the week. By-appointment-only, naturally.

Oh, and by closing my favorite on-campus coffee place, of course.

Now, it's not all that bad, really. There are also interesting new discoveries to be made. Like, that the computing center (Rechenzentrum) apparently has a <em>women-only</em> computer pool. In an imaginary press release, they might say: <em>"The new, three-desk facility was established to give all women studying computer science in Karlsruhe room to work at once."</em> Of course, I am exaggerating. The actual <a href="http://www.zvw.uni-karlsruhe.de/stat/stud/allg/ver/fak11.htm">student statistics for 2008</a> reveal a whopping 10&nbsp;% of students in computer science are women here. And at any rate, the computing services are used by students in other departments as well. But, more seriously, what's wrong with the other computers? Guess I'll never know.
