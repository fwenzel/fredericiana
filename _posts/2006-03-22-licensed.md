Finally I got my Oregon License and from now on, I won't have to
<ul>
	<li>give people my passport</li>
	<li>take care of the immigration documents not to fall out of it</li>
	<li>show them which page to look at</li>
	<li>help them to find the birth date on it</li>
	<li>wait five minutes until they can finally read it</li>
	<li>make an evil face to match the photo</li>
</ul>

anymore.

Yeah :)

I will miss the <em>evil face</em> part, though ;)
