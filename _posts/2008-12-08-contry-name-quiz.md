So I stumbled across this <a href="http://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/how-many-countries-can-you-name.php">"How Many Countries Can You Name?" Quiz</a> where you need to name as many (sovereign) country names as you can in 5 minutes.

I got a 59 at my first try, while the average is 57 (even though some people take it many times, as the result screen notes).

I do admit it's hard to think of so many countries in very limited time -- and sometimes I pathetically failed at guessing the English spelling of a country's name as well, such as Maur<strong>i</strong>tania, Kazakhstan, and others...

How many can you come up with?
