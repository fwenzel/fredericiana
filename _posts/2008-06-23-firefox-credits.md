The Firefox world record attempt has just <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">weighed in</a> with a whopping <strong>8 million downloads</strong> (plus change) in a 24-hour period.

And, as I recently noticed, each Firefox instance carries my name among the men and women mentioned in the credits list (for my work on the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">Mozilla Add-ons</a> project):

<img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/firefox-credits.jpg" alt="My name in the Firefox 3 credits." title="Firefox Credits" width="381" height="532" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1314" />
Awesome :) (did I mention I dig my name being spelled correctly?)

If you want to see who else is on the list, click on <em>"About Firefox"</em> in the help (or Firefox, on Mac) menu, then <em>"Credits"</em>.

Thanks to Mike Connor (who I believe put me on the list) and to everybody who made Firefox 3 such a great product.
