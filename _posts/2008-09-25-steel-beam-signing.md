Today I signed the steel beam for the <a href="http://gatescenter.blog.cs.cmu.edu/">Gates Center</a>, the big, new, not-yet-shiny computer science building on the CMU campus (now called the "Gates-Hillman-Complex", after the Hillman Foundation donated additional funds).

It's a white painted steel beam that will be built into the building later. Very neat idea!

Here are some pics:
