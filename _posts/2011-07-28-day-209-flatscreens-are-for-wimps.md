Oh, nostalgia. This is a 27 inch iMac pretending to run an ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">CRT display</a> terminal complete with flickering, slow display times, 25 lines and all the other goodness that we used to mean when we were talking about computers a little more than 20 years ago.

The epic emulator software is appropriately called <a href="http://www.secretgeometry.com/apps/cathode/">Cathode</a>.
