Mmmmh, finally an actual Bavarian-Style Hefeweizen! Thank you, Trader Joe's! Also, funny how they changed the branding on these bottles since last week. It was Trader Joe's before and now it's Josephsbräu, both from San Jose. By the way, if the label design looks familiar (Gordon Biersch, anyone?) there's probably a reason for this :)
