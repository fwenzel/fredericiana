Today, I decided to give my blog a new look -- mostly because I was tired of the old, white, colorless layout. After a little while, I found a nice one in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/">Wordpress theme directory</a> (so, props to the guy who designed <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/other/right-sidebar/3149/fast-swing-10/">this</a> :) )

<strong>Old</strong> (left) vs. <strong>new</strong> (right):

If you find something not working, or you want to let me know that the new layout sucks even more than the old one ;) feel free to leave a comment.
