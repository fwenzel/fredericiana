This morning, I got a kick out of looking at the origins of the <strong>license plates</strong> I came across while walking to school. To my surprise, there were quite a few, which is why I share the list with you (in alphabetical order, not by preference ;) ):

<blockquote>California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New&nbsp;Jersey, New&nbsp;York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South&nbsp;Carolina, Texas, Virginia</blockquote>

And two that don't come from a US state:

<blockquote>Ontario (Canada) and a US federal license plate ("For government use only")</blockquote>

That's a total of 16 different origins. Not bad for a single walk!

Also, if you'd like to see the history of how license plates looked in your state then and now, I found the website <a href="http://www.15q.net/">15q.net</a> that has a pretty comprehensive picture collection that's worth checking out.
