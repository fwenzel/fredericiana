I totally forgot blogging about this!

Remember how I curate a collection of <a href="http://fredericiana.com/tag/failpet/">fail pets</a> across the Interwebs? <a href="http://uxmag.com/readers/sean-rintel">Sean Rintel</a> is a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia and has put some thought into the UX implications of whimsical error messages, published in his article: <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/the-evolution-of-fail-pets">The Evolution of Fail Pets: Strategic Whimsy and Brand Awareness in Error Messages</a></strong> in UX Magazine.

In his article, Rintel attributes me with coining the term "fail pet".

Attentive readers may also notice that Mozilla's strategy of (rightly) attributing Adobe Flash's crashes with Flash itself by putting a "sad brick" in place worked formidably: Rintel (just like most users, I am sure) assumes this message comes from Adobe, not Mozilla:

<img src="/media/wp/2012/06/sad-brick.jpg" alt="" title="Sad Brick: Adobe Flash crashed" width="500" height="159" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4980" />

Thanks, Sean, for the mention, and I hope you all enjoy his article.
