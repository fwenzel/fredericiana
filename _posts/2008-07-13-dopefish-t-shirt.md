Recently I got caught up in Wikipedia again, this times investigating the computer games of my youth :) One of them was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen">Commander Keen</a>, whose page sent me straight to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopefish">Dopefish</a>.

Soon after I felt the urge to put a dopefish on a t-shirt. What do you think of that design?

Or, do you prefer this (possibly less obtrusive) version?
