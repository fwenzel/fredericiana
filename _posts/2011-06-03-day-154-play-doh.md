At work, I have a lot to do with a project called <a href="http://mozilla.github.com/playdoh/">playdoh</a> (if you care: A web application template based on Django!). This has absolutely nothing to do with modeling clay for children, but today I got a hold of a tub anyway. If kids visit, I'll be all set ;)
