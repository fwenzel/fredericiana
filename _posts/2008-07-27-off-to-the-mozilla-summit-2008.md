Yay, I am out and about for the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2008">Mozilla Summit 2008</a> in the beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler%2C_British_Columbia">Whistler, British Columbia, Canada</a>.

It's going to be an exciting week with a lot of people I know and haven't seen in a long time, and there will be many new people to meet as well. I am looking forward to it!

Whistler itself is a breathtaking place, they say, so I am particularly thrilled that such a great place was picked for the event. I know at least one of my friends is jealous because he'd love to go mountain-biking there!

If you want to see what's going on at the Mozilla Summit, hop on over to <a href="http://summit.mozilla.org/">summit.mozilla.org</a>, a new mash-up site showing tons of media related to the summit. Soon it'll look much fuller than this:

I'll write again when I'm there :)
