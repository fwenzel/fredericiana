I was going to wear my newly-acquired <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/honey-badger">Honey Badger Don't Care</a> shirt to work today, but it turns out it has a sewing error on the sleeve. Because I don't want to look like a honey badger just attacked me and ripped my shirt to shreds, I'll try and get it replaced. Honey badger might not care, but I do ;)
