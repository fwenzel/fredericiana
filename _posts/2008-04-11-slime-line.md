Something tells me, this sign I came across in a German store has one <strong>"e"</strong> too much:

<a href='http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/slime-line.jpg'><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/slime-line-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="Slime Line" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1270" /></a>

Or maybe I just missed the latest trend and in fact, <em>slime is the new black</em>.
