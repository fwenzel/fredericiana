I am just getting a <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/bverfg_cgi/pressemitteilungen/bvg05-071">press release (germ.)</a> from the German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany">Federal Constitutional Court</a> (which can be found in direct neighbourhood to the University of Karlsruhe which I attend).<br />
<br />
It says that there will be a hearing next week concerning the recent <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-5158006,00.html">dissolution of the German Parliament</a>. Some MPs <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000100&sid=aMFOi3U9mq60&refer=germany">sought the Constitutional Court</a> in order to stop early elections.<br />
<br />
As itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so near and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going to leave town for quite a long time shortly, I am really tempted to attend the hearing (as part of the public).<br />
<br />
I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know whether itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s allowed, though - but usually, it is supposed to. :)
