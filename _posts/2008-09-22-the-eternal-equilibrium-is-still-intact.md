Surfing around on kayak.com for affordable destinations for my planned, hopefully then-deserved post-master's-thesis vacation, I browsed through the list of travel destinations, glancing over Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, ....

Wait a minute. <strong>Cuba?</strong>

Sure enough I was curious, so I clicked it and got the following message.

Ah. Everything's still in order, the trade embargo hasn't been lifted without my knowledge, Pennsylvania liquor stores are still safe from the invasion of evil Cuban rum, cigar stores can still sell Dominican cigars with the slogan <em>"taste almost like Cubans"</em> with only mildly ridiculing themselves, and kayak.com saved itself from committing treason at the last minute. Phew, time to dry the sweat off my face.
