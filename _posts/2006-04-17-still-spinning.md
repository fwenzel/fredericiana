Long time no blog. Didn't have too much time to do geeky stuff recently :-/

Doesn't mean the world stopped spinning, though:

You know that the world is still spinning the right way when:

<ul>
	<li>the preacher in front of the university library is still preaching, as usual</li>
	<li>the fellow students are still wearing either pjs or shorts, regardless if it's less than 50 degrees (10 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) outside</li>
	<li>the sun is shining but at the same time it's raining anyway. After all, this is Oregon.</li>
	<li>you found yet another annoying yet ineffective <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Liquor_Control_Commission">OLCC</a> trap that kept you from buying a beer in spite of you being old enough</li>
	<li>due to the obvious lack of sound isolation, you can still hear every single step of your neighbors upstairs</li>
	<li>the commercials still use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen">German</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flugtag">words</a> to sound more "hip"... and it apparently works</li>
	<li>and after all, you seem to be the only one thinking that some of these things are a little weird, sometimes ;)</li>
</ul>
