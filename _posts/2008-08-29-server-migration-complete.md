The <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/08/29/server-migration/">server migration</a> I announced earlier should be complete now.

The DNS entries may still be a little wonky (if you had trouble reaching my web page or even sending me an email for a little while, that's probably why), but apart from that all should be peachy. The new box is quite snappy, so that's good!

Oh, of course the new server has a new name, too: Rest in peace, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(mythology)">Aurora</a>, and welcome to the family, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(goddess)">Luna</a>!
