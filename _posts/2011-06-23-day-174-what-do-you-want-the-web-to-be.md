Successful way to engage the community at <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>'s and <a href="http://myemma.com/">Emma</a>'s shared Open Source Bridge conference party last night. <em>What do you want the Web to be?</em> A creative wish list for the future of the Web that we're planning to put back up at the Mozilla offices. For reference, you know. Thanks to everyone who participated!
