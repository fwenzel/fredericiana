Who ever had the brilliant idea to put the RW logo on every writable DVD kind, no matter if it is <strong>actually rewritable or only writable once</strong>?

I know, there's a de-facto-standard group out there called the <a href="http://www.dvdrw.com/">DVD+RW alliance</a>. Its well-known members have got together in order to agree on an industry standard for rewritable DVDs. As such, they decided to put an RW into the alliance's logo, and consequently on all licensed products, no matter what kind.

But writing <strong>RW</strong> in fat letters on once-writable media and only mentioning the actual product properties in fine print, that just sucks. Seriously.
