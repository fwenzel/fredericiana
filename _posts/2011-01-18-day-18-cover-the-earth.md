This is the logo and slogan of a paint company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwin-Williams">Sherwin-Williams</a>. Every time I see this, I am thoroughly baffled by how wrong, on how many levels this is.

Their logo is a <strong>paint bucket</strong>, dumping red, thick paint <strong>all over planet earth</strong>, and their slogan is <strong>"Cover the Earth"</strong>. You don't have to be particularly environmentally inclined to recognize that covering our entire planet with harmful chemicals is perhaps not the best thing mankind could do. Now, I realize they don't mean this <em>literally</em> (or at least, I sincerely hope so). But it still makes me wonder if this is really all the person who invented the logo (presumably all the way back in the 19th century, when the company was founded) could come up with? <em>"It's paint. It's like any other paint on the planet. Well except that ours thrives to cover the planet. Yup, all of it. Like a frozen banana. Except not edible."</em>

Wow.

Regarding the pic: This is a cellphone shot, little grainy on the bottom, and due to the bright sunshine (oh NorCal in January, I love thee) it was quite overexposed, so I messed with the contrast and saturation a bit until it looked acceptable.
