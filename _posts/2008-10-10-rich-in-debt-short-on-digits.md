The US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Debt_Clock">national debt clock</a> was recently <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4910883.ece">running out of digits</a>:

<blockquote>It appears even technology cannot cope with the global financial crisis: the National Debt Clock in New York has run out of digits for the first time.
(...)
As a temporary fix the dollar sign has been switched to a figure--the '1' in $10 trillion. The clock is currently marking the US federal governmentâ€™s national debt at about $10.2 trillion.</blockquote>

That reminds me of the German national debt clock, that I ran across quite accidentally a few years ago when on vacation in Berlin. I took a photo and subsequently <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:BDS_Schuldenuhr.jpg">donated it to Wikipedia</a>:

<a href="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/schuldenuhr.jpg"><img src="http://fredericiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/schuldenuhr-533x400.jpg" alt="" title="Bund der Steuerzahler Schuldenuhr" width="533" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1668" /></a>

At the time, it was at roughly 1.4 trillion Euros, while now it's already <a href="http://www.steuerzahler.de/">well over 1.5 </a>.

The good news is: At least the German clock is not running out of digits soon. If that's any consolation, with a per-capita share of 18.000 Euros in debt, is a different story.
