* The design is based on jsncostello's fabulous [slate theme][slate].
* I adopted (and modified) some of tswicegood's excellent little
  [Jekyll extensions][tswicegood].
* The XML feeds are derived from snaptortoise's [jekyll-rss-feeds][jekyll-rss].
* The social icons are from the [IconDock Mono Social Icon set][icondock].
