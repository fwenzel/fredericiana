A week of work, and the world already turns out to be entirely a village: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/about.html">Dan Mosedale</a>, lead developer on the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:Lightning">Lightning Project</a> (= Mozilla Calendar as a Thunderbird extension) spent a year at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Karlsruhe">University of Karlsruhe</a> studying Informatik (computer science) in the early 1990s.

About a decade later, I started studying there, and I still am.

Looks like -- to use the words of one of my favorite professors in Germany -- <em>Karlsruhe rules</em> :)
