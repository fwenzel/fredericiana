Today was work-from-home day for me, which means I can wear a shirt like this -- that I usually wouldn't wear in public, or people would think I am a Googler, and we don't want this, do we? I got the shirt a few weeks ago at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2011/">PyCon</a> where Google had a booth and handed out these t-shirts if you solved a Python problem for them. All right! By the way, the back reads, <em>Python: Programming how Guido Indented it</em>. Oh, how punny :)
