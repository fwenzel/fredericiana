Oh, hello! The MSIE team sent us <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2006/10/24/from-redmond-with-love/">another</a> cake. This time, sadly, I wasn't around to taste it, but it looks much nicer than the old one! Internet Explorer just started getting color, it seems like!

Here it is, photo courtesy of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/robceemoz/2587912633/">robcee</a>:

I hope it tasted as delicious as the first one!
