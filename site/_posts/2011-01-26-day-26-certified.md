Today I got (re-)certified for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPR">CPR</a>! The photo shows a handy little bag with a CPR face mask in it.

It was my third first-aid class, but this was the first time that I learned how to do infant CPR (and perform it on a baby-sized mannequin). It was also only the second time I got to try out an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_external_defibrillator">AED</a>. (In case you're wondering, they are so simple a kid can use them).

Now let's all still refrain from having heart attacks in my general vicinity, will ya?
