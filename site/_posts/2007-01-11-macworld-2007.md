Hello again and greetings from <strong>MacWorld 2007 in San Francisco!</strong>

<div style="width:180px;text-align:right;"><a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/wenzel/631139/" title="Zooomr Photo Sharing :: Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.zooomr.com/images/631139_a95b043731_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Macworld 2007" border="0" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a></div>

To be exact, from the Microsoft Blogger Lounge. That sounds strange, but <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/05/microsoft-mac-bu-sponsors-blogger-lounge-at-macworld/">it's true</a> ;) And while the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jan07/01-09MacworldPR.mspx">upcoming (?) Microsoft Office 2008</a> ranks pretty high on my (ever-growing) list of things I could not care less about, the whole blogger lounge thing is a pretty nice move. But then again, it seems kind of lame that they just offer wired Internet: That's about as lame (or 1992, or web 1.0, you name it) as it gets. Here are some pics:

Macworld is an interesting type of expo. Almost every single booth offers something you can attach to your iPod, or software you can run on your Mac, or more or less useful things you probably never really need, but people buy anyway.

By the way: While Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/09/software-not-addressed-in-macworld-keynote/">deliberately ignored the whole "software" topic</a> in his keynote on Monday, he leaves this job to his employees, presenting key features of Mac OS X 10.5 on one of the two gigantic screens that form the center of the whole expo floor. On the other one, by the way, some nameless Apple person also played with an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>, with lots of curious Mac users listening.

However the actual star of this year, in my opinion is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> which -- and I am not sure why -- gets quite a bit less attention from the visitors than the iPhone (even though the latter is <a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/wenzel/631176">hidden behind glass</a>). But judging from what I see on the neat HDTV screens they are showing off...

<div style="width:240px;text-align:right;"><a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/wenzel/631178/" title="Zooomr Photo Sharing :: Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.zooomr.com/images/631178_fda4a48edc_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Macworld 2007" border="0" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a></div>

... the Apple TV could really be an enhancement for my living room. Also, it doesn't seem to be as ridiculously overpriced as the iPhone.
