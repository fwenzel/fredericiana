I was just trying to find out how many Euros a specific US invoice equaled last year at the time that I paid it.

Where can I find the exchange rate from 10 Dollars to Euros on April 1, 2007?

Sadly, just entering it into Google won't work of course, since over the last year the Dollar-to-Euro exchange rate has changed more drastically than a beer lover's facial expression after a sip of <em>Coors Light</em>: Searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=10%20dollars%20to%20euros">"10 dollars to euros"</a> there reports <strong>6.42 Euros</strong> at the moment.

After a little digging however, I found <a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/exchform.html">Bank of Canada's currency conversion page</a>, where you can request daily conversion rates dating back until 1997.

According to that page, in our little example above, 10 US Dollars equaled <strong>7.48 Euros</strong> at the time.

Very useful, indeed!
