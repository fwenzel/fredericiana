A bump in the road, quite literally. To my great amusement, Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_bump">mentions</a> this is also known as a <strong>sleeping policeman</strong> or <strong>slow child</strong>, hah. Not to be confused, of course, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_hump">speed hump</a>, which is a beast of an entirely different dimension and was possibly referred to by the Black Eyed Peas in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Humps">one</a> of their songs a few years ago, though probably not.
