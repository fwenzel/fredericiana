Now it has happened: As an effect of the urgent need for a weekend, I registered with <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. Only adding people I could think of easily, I am not "following" 37 people ;)

Of course, my twitter experience started all peachy right off the bat, by first giving me site errors:

<a href='http://www.ipernity.com/doc/fredw/2342602'><img src="/media/wp/2008/07/twitter-site-error.jpg" alt="" title="Twitter Site Error" width="240" height="187" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1324" /></a>&nbsp;<a href='http://www.ipernity.com/doc/fredw/2342603'><img src="/media/wp/2008/07/twitter-site-error-2.jpg" alt="" title="Twitter Site Error" width="240" height="192" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1325" /></a>
(hey, at least they are pretty)

... and then I noticed something weird about the times they show on every page:

<img src="/media/wp/2008/07/twitter-germenglish.jpg" alt="" title="Twitter: Germenglish" width="268" height="52" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1326" />
<strong>"ungef√§hr 1 Stunde ago from web..."</strong> ... is that... Germenglish? Englerman?

But let's not be discouraged. They probably just started their announced maintenance window four hours early ;)

Anyone else think I forgot to "follow" them on twitter? Leave a comment.
