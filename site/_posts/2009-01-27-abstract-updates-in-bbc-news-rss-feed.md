I am unsure what happened, but today my <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News</a> RSS feed seems to be showing when an abstract was updated by the authors after its initial release.

While I have not found anything too exciting or revealing among the affected posts, it is interesting to see how the journalists refine their work to make it both concise and informative. In this case, Obama's "middle east envoy"'s name apparently went away in favor of "friendship with the muslim world", and the authors realized that more than one country has a "president".
