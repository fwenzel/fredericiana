title: Say Hello to wenzel.io
---

The other day, I made a thing:

Say hello to my new project playground called [wenzel.io][wenzelio]!

[![wenzel.io](/media/2013/wenzelio.jpg)][wenzelio]

Over the years, I've been publishing a number of open source projects of varying size, and for a long time now, I wanted to have a project site to list them all (the interesting ones, anyway). 

Sure, I have a [github project list](https://github.com/fwenzel?tab=repositories), but that's only a poor substitute, because it contains all sorts of work related to my day job that bubbles to the top, not letting me show off the projects I want.

Plus, some of my projects need to be deployed somewhere on the Web on their own domains for various reasons. I was never sure what domain to put these on. Now I can create *newproject.wenzel.io* and off I go!

Finally, if you're interested in the back story behind some of the projects, click on the individual project's names and take a look at their project pages (like [this one for python-bcrypt](http://wenzel.io/projects/python-bcrypt/), for example).

[Check it out][wenzelio] and let me know what you think!
