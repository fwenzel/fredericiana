The buddy I am currently staying with called me a nerd today because I was putting on a <a href="http://store.mozilla.org/">Firefox T-Shirt</a>. Oh, little does he know, poor fellow.

I wonder what he had said if he knew that we just set up an <a href="http://openvpn.net">OpenVPN</a> server on our wireless router at home to be able to log in from a distance and program our dad's satellite receiver? We call it the 6.500 kilometer remote control.
