This is one of my favorite coffee mugs: I bought it back in 2002 at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinuxTag">LinuxTag open source conference</a> in Karlsruhe, Germany. The motto of that year's conference -- "Open Your Mind, Open Your Heart, Open Your Source" -- hints at what this conference was still very much about: Convincing decision makers, in particular in government organizations, to recognize the potential in open source software and treat it as an opportunity rather than a threat. Luckily, we've come a long way since then.
