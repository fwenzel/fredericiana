<a href="http://zooomr.com">Zooomr</a>, a "web 2.0" website for photos, is in my opinion the <strong>most promising <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> competitor</strong> around. It shares a lot of features with its well-known big brother that was bought by yahoo a while ago.

As I found out today, since a few months, Zooomr is <a href="http://blog.zooomr.com/2006/11/01/trickr-or-treatr-pro-accounts-upgraded-to-4gbmo-free-accounts-to-100mmo/">still</a> handing out <a href="http://blog.zooomr.com/2006/07/20/more-love-for-bloggers-25gb-free-pro-accounts/">"pro" accounts for bloggers</a> that are free for one year. So today I upgraded my free zooomr account, uploading my first high-resolution picture to the service and blogging it in my <a href="http://fredericiana.de/archives/2006/12/02/fruhstart-in-san-francisco/">German blog</a>:

<a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/7347@Z01/474415/" title="Zooomr Photo Sharing :: Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.zooomr.com/images/474415_05d53751bf_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Christmas in November" border="0" style="border:1px solid #000;" class="center" /></a>

My first impression of Zooomr is that it works very flawlessly and is by all means worth a thought when you decide where to host your photos. While I have set up an instance of <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com">Gallery 2</a> for my own photos, I always had the problem that I needed to scale them down to, say, 800x600 pixels. Otherwise every single photo would eat up around 2 megabytes-or-so of my personal web space, eventually filling up space needed for the actual websites etc.

Also, modern photo sharing sites come with a lot of nice features like RSS feeds, tags etc.; through their photo sharing capabilities, they are much easier to integrate into blogs or other web applications than classic photo tools.

Therefore I will give zooomr a shot for a while now, and eventually I will decide if I want to put all my photos on there or not. A big part of my decision will obviously be how much they want to charge me after the free year. Flickr takes 25 Dollars per year which, while it is not a lot, has kept me from signing up there so far, because I was unsure if I would use it enough to justify the (long-term) investment.

Come on, zooomr, convince me! ;)
