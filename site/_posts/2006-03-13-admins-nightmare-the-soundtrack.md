The harddrive manufacturer Hitachi offers something new on its website:

<a href="http://www.hitachigst.com/hddt/knowtree.nsf/cffe836ed7c12018862565b000530c74/4b1a62a50f405d0d86256756006e340c?OpenDocument">Noises that indicate hard drive failure</a> in WAV format.

Be warned, it's not for the faint of heart. Now that's what I call a nightmarish soundtrack - hopefully nobody sues them because of the emotional pain when hearing harddrives crash ;)
