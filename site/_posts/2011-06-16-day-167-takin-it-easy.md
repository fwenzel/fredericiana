Lizzy, taking it easy after a long day of sleeping, napping, eating, and sniffing.

I think this photo is kind of cool since it looks like a Sepia effect or something but it's just the automatic white balance failing on a brown background and black-and-white dog in the foreground. If I had to guess, I'd say white-balance detection is the automation that fails me the most when taking photos. Unsurprisingly, it is probably the hardest property for the camera to get right, whenever no proper reference point (read: true white) is present in the frame. Interesting problem!
