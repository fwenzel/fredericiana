How you you know you just walked straight through a worm hole and reached 1985?

<img id="image128" src="/media/wp/2006/11/sbod.gif" alt="Spinning Beachball of Death; Source: Wikipedia" class="alignright" />When you try to <strong>unmount an unreachable network drive</strong> and instead of succeeding after a little while, you get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_wait_cursor">spinning beachball of death</a> leaving you -- after waiting naively for 15 minutes (I went to get my mail etc.) -- with no other possibility than hard-resetting your computer.

While I like my Mac a lot, this is one of the days when I want to ask:

<strong>Apple, when do you finally reach the 21st century?</strong>
