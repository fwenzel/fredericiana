Today's mad <a href="http://glow.mozilla.org">Firefox 4 launch</a> is an excellent opportunity for me to decorate my laptop with stickers for the first time ever. If you have any other stickers I should put on it, let me know :) You can also send them to me, of course <em>(Fred Wenzel, c/o Mozilla, 650 Castro St #300, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA)</em> if you're so inclined. Let's get that canvas decorated!

Also, in case you haven't done so yet: Firefox 4 is available for download now, and it is not only faster and nicer than ever, it is also available in a whopping 82 languages. <a href="http://mozilla.com">Download it today!</a>
