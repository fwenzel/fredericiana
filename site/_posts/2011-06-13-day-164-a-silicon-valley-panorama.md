Another parental "guest photo": A Silicon Valley panorama, as seen from the hills on the east side of the valley, looking west. (Obviously, clicking on it and zooming in makes sense).

<strong>Update, June 14:</strong> This is the same photo, retaken with a tripod and stitched together. Woah!

Enjoy the view (and the Northern Californian sunshine)!
