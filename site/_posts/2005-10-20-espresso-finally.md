<a title="Sex, Herrenschokolade &amp; Rock'n'roll" href="http://flickr.com/photos/65452483@N00/53380646/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/53380646_0a142289f6_m.jpg" width="240" height="179" class="alignright" /></a>Being stuck in a country that - I don't quite know how to put this, but, ... hmmm ... - does <em>strange</em> things to food in general, I had almost given up trying to find <strong>espresso</strong> that actually deserves the name. I mean, regular coffee is mostly okay over here, even though you have to take care not to get a decaffeinated or oddly flavored kind by mistake.

However, when it comes to espresso, the americans seem to mess up totally.

Usually you can choose between <em>one shot</em> and <em>two shot</em> espresso (often hurtingly misspelled as <em>ex</em>presso). One shot meaning like 6 ounces, two shots 12 or so. Basically, this is somehow three or four times as much as a usual Italian espresso, while being half as strong as it is supposed to be. Even Starbucks - though being supposed to know the coffee business better than most people in the world - contributes to this collective <em>espresso-raping</em> over here. What a pity.

But then, yesterday, I really found a <strong>gelateria</strong> (yes, it <em>is</em> honestly called like that) downtown that really has a genuine italian espresso machine, unbelievably making genuine italian caffÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ (= espresso). Woohoo! Now that was a surprise. (It's sort of excusable therefore, that the staff understands no single italian word, thus having to pronounce things like <em>lampone</em> (= raspberry) in a very american manner... ;) )

Anyways, I think I'm going to step by <em>Francesco's</em> more often now. It gives kind of a European feeling to me on <em>diaspora</em> ;)
