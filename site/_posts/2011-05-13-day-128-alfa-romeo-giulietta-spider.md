This is an old Alfa Romeo convertible, as seen near Milan, Italy. It's what I believe to be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_Giulietta">Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider</a>, model year 1955. It's such an awesome vehicle that the owner could not resist to drive it with the roof down, even in the middle of the night in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_%28river%29">Po river</a> valley, where the rice fields spawn a disturbing number of mosquitoes at this time of year.
