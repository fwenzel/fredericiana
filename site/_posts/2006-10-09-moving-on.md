So, I posted this a while ago in <a href="http://fredericiana.de/archives/2006/08/30/moving-on/">German</a>, but I forgot to put it on the English blog, too:

<blockquote>
It's time. After studying at OSU for a year, I now have to go back and finish my <a href="http://www.informationswirtschaft.de/en/ueb/teaser1">masters degree</a> at my <a href="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/index_en.php">home university in Germany, the University of Karlsruhe</a>.

Well, almost.

My German university demands an internship for the completion of my degree. Thus it's time for me to leave the <a href="http://osuosl.org">OSU Open Source Lab</a> and its <a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/trends/05/10/07/1833225.shtml">"most important racks in Open Source"</a>. Sad, really sad.

And I leave half sadly but happily as well: Sadly, because for a soon-information-engineer, working passionately on Open Source Software while studying (and even getting paid for it) was pretty cool. I could see from the inside what holds the world of Open Source together, and I was pleased to collaborate with some of the finest people in the sphere of free software. Recently for example I even had the opportunity to visit the "OSCON" Open Source Conference in Portland, Oregon. At the OSL, we were not even short on geek-ness: Working only a few feet away from the Linux Kernel master server, important Gentoo and Debian servers as well as Apache and phpBB boxes, that is more than unique and a reason for me to say, <strong>Thank you, OSU OSL!</strong>

But then, there's also the happy side. Because after a marathon of job interviews (around 15, if I remember correctly) with different companies (not 15, of course but I was passed on between different people) I could decide a few weeks ago where I wanted to go for an internship.

Of course, it is Open Source related.

Since the beginning of October I am proud to work at the <strong>Mozilla Corporation in Mountain View, California as a Software Development Intern</strong>.

People are nice, the environment is geeky and relaxed and I like how many interesting things are happening here. <strong>Good to be with you, Mozilla people!</strong>
