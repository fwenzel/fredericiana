This is what it looks like when we release software at Mozilla. Except for when it doesn't. This was actually a fairly unusual day, when (most) developers, IT, product, and QA all found themselves in a conference room in Mountain View. Usually, this is much more virtual, with the "room" being an IRC channel or perhaps a conference call, all of which spanning multiple time zones.

Because releasing software alone wasn't challenge enough :)
