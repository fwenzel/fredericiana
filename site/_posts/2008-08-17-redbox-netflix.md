When I went to Giant Eagle earlier this week, I got a two DVDs from the <a href="http://www.redbox.com/">Redbox DVD rental machine</a> in front of the store, as I felt like watching a movie and they only charge 1 dollar plus tax a day, which is really cheap. Sadly, one of the DVDs was so <strong>badly scratched</strong> that my drive wouldn't even read it: After a few unsuccessful tries at spinning up the disc, it spit it right back out -- though my DVD player isn't even usually that picky about what it eats (I'll spare you the reference to Americans and their fast food).

Sure enough, I called customer service (1-800-REDBOX3, in case you were wondering) and they apologized, marked the disc as "to be removed from circulation" and gave me two codes for free rentals in return.

So I took back the discs, and got two new ones -- only to notice that one of them was, yet again, looking like somebody had used it as a <strong>coaster</strong>:

Though they gave me another replacement code, I decided to try something different to satisfy my urge for movies and TV shows: I signed up for <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a>.

The idea of finding a new movie in the mail box when I come home from work sounded appealing to me. So I already put 20 discs into the queue which, considering I have the 1-DVD-at-a-time-plan, will probably take ages to go through, but we'll see how it goes. Another cool feature is their <em>"watch instantly"</em> collection, but I may blog about that some other time.

I wonder what my <strong>readers</strong> use to <strong>get to their movies</strong>? <strong>Let me know in the comments.</strong>
