It's been awhile since I last had to <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/08/29/server-migration/">announce</a> planned maintenance here, so here we go:

My <a href="http://domainworld.de">current domain service provider</a> closes down its consumer services at the end of the year, prompting me to transfer all the domains that I own (including fredericiana.com) to a different service provider. I have chosen <a href="http://domainfactory.de">domainfactory</a>, a well-established player in the market that I read good reviews about.

Please bear with me while the transfer is in progress and the name servers are being switched over. It should soon be smooth sailing again. But, if problems persist, as always, just shoot me an email.

Thanks!

<strong>Update:</strong> I am glad to report my domains have all been transferred properly and everything should be back to normal now.
