Somebody told me recently, this year's Oregon winter would become colder, yet less wet than what the common Oregonian would call a "usual winter".

He read it on the internet - therefore <em>it must be true</em>, right? ;)

The current weather at least seems to sustain his theory. Pretty cold hands and ears when riding the bike in the morning, but a relatively dry seat... seems to be much better of a weather for me as a part-time Oregonian! It was even nice enough for me to take a handful of new photos from my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/freeed/tags/fall+oregonstateuniversity/">"fall at osu series"</a>...
