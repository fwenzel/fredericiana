<blockquote>Hi. I just noticed that your site looks like it has a <strong>few code problems at the very bottom of your site's page</strong>. I'm not sure if everybody is getting this same problem when browsing your blog? I am employing a totally different browser than most people, referred to as <strong>Opera</strong>, so that is what might be causing it? I just wanted to make sure you know. Thanks for posting some great postings and I'll try to return back with a completely different browser to check things out!</blockquote>

Not only does my blog display just fine in Opera (yes, I checked), I get even more bogus comments at times claiming that my blog looks horrible in <strong>Firefox</strong>, of all browsers. Dear spammers, now you're just making fools of yourselves.

The main thing identifying this kind of comment as spam (other than the bogus claim that my blog doesn't render correctly in non-Internet-Explorer browsers) is the URL these comments come with. Usually, they promise a "free" iPod, MacBook, car, house, airplane or ride to the moon (<em>exaggeration: mine</em>).

I wonder how many bloggers actually publish these, thinking it's well-meant advice. :(
