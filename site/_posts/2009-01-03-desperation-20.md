Remember when everybody and their brother made a little website with lots of "under construction" signs and excessive use of the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag? No? Lucky you.

Of course, these times are long over, now everybody has their own blog, and facebook, and myspace, and, uhm yeah, twitter. Of course, woe is yours when you realize nobody wants to read what you had for lunch. Or dinner. Or that you went to the store and bought toilet paper (gasp! on sale!)...

But thankfully, if you have a few bucks to spare, you can always count on Google Adsense to spread the word of your oh-so-boring personal updates across the globe. Like this gentleman, who decided to show ads on people's Gmail accounts, in order to get more readers to his twitter account:

<a href="/media/wp/2009/01/google-twitter.jpg"><img src="/media/wp/2009/01/google-twitter-575x41.jpg" alt="Google and Twitter" title="Google and Twitter" width="575" height="41" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1893" /></a>

Now considering he is deeming himself an "online media" expert -- couldn't he have guessed that this kind of self-promotion is a huge cyber-turnoff?

Dear slowing economy, could you free the Internet from this and similar "SEO" annoyances in 2009, please? Probably as likely as the hell freezing over or the spammers running out of money, but one can always hope.
