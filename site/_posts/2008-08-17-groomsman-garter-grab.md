After I came back from Whistler, BC, I stopped by in Oregon, where I had the pleasure to be a groomsman at one of my best friends' wedding: <a href="http://justindow.com/2008/08/15/married/">Justin married his Karen</a>.

It was a lot of fun, though I didn't imagine it being so complicated to get married in this country that you need to rehearse the day before. ;)

Of course, the other guys wanted to set me up to catch the garter, but I got miraculously saved. Needless to say, this is the 21<sup>st</sup> century, so it's on youtube:

From my "exchange student" point of view, I have to say, this gave me much deeper insight into American society than any other event I attended here (and I've been in the US for a while). It is sad most exchange students have to miss out on this.

PS: I've officially worn enough pink that day to last me well through my twenties!
