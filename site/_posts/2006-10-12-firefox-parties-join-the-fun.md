The release of Firefox 2 is coming up, and great things need to be celebrated. Thus yesterday, the <a href="http://www.firefoxparty.com/">firefoxparty</a> website was released!

Partying is easy: If you host, add your party to the list and let the world know that you are going to celebrate the new, exciting release of your favorite webbrowser.

If you want to <em>join</em> a party, take a look at the <a href="http://www.firefoxparty.com/parties/">map</a> or the <a href="http://www.firefoxparty.com/parties/view/all/">list</a> and register as a Firefox party goer.

At the time of writing, you have the choice of <strong>more than 130 firefox 2 parties</strong> worldwide with at least 400 fellow party animals :)

Let's rock! Firefox: <strong>Take back the dancefloor!</strong>
