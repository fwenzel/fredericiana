Sadly, the Pittsburgh Penguins lost their game against the Detroit Red Wings last night. Watching the game downtown was fun nonetheless. Plus, while during the course of the game it became quite apparent that the Red Wings are the stronger team, at the very end the Pens put a tremendous effort into tying the game to get into overtime and they almost made it! In the last second of the game, the puck was literally *on* the Red Wings' goal line.

I also got myself a t-shirt with the Pens' captain's name on it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby">Sidney Crosby</a>) -- I mean, when in Rome...
