So there is this guy, who says he has eaten <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/story//ap/20080909/ap_on_fe_st/odd23000_big_macs">23.000 big macs over the course of 36 years</a> and obviously, kept all the receipts.

If these were the presidential elections, I would demand a recount, but <em>in dubio pro reo</em> and all, let's assume he is right. Of course I wanted to know how many big macs that totals per day, so I entered into Google:

<blockquote>23&nbsp;000 / (36 years)</blockquote>

and what did I get back? Obviously, <strong>big macs per second</strong>:

By the way: Using more conventional units, this totals between 1 and 2 big macs a day.

PS: Random fact I am sure none of you wanted to know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz">Heinrich Hertz</a>, the guy whose name became the unit of frequency "hertz", was a professor at University of Karlsruhe (my home uni), where he discovered the electromagnetic waves.
