Yesterday on Discovery Channel:

<blockquote>Most regular <strong>toilets flush</strong> in the <strong>key of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%E2%99%AD_(musical_note)">e-flat</a></strong>.</blockquote>

Well, add this to the list of things I am not sure I needed to know.

Still, I am wondering if that means from now on I should set my tuner aside and just tune my trumpet after the toilet? Of course I'd need to call the plumber about once a year when the whole thing is out of tune ;)

Yeah, me and my silly mind. I know.
