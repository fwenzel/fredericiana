<strong>Update:</strong> The author of pdftk, Sid Steward, left the following comment:
<blockquote>
A new version of pdftk is available (1.43) that fixes many bugs. This release also features an installer [for] OS X 10.6. Please visit to learn more and download: <a href="http://www.pdflabs.com">www.pdflabs.com</a>.
</blockquote>
This blog post will stick around for the time being, but I (the author of this blog) advise you to always run the latest version so that you can enjoy the latest bug fixes.

<em>OS X Leopard users:</em> Sorry, neither this version nor the installer offered on pdflabs.com works on OS X before 10.6. You might be able to compile from source though. Let us know if you are successful.

Due to my being a remote employee, I get to juggle with PDF files quite a bit. A great tool for common PDF manipulations (changing page order, combining files, rotating pages etc) has proven to be <a href="http://www.pdfhacks.com/pdftk/">pdftk</a>. Sadly, a current version for Mac OS X is not available on their homepage. In addition, it is annoying (to say the least) to compile, which is why all three third-party package management systems that I know of (MacPorts, fink, as well as homebrew), last time I checked, did not have it at all, or their versions were broken.

Now I wouldn't be a geek if that kept me from compiling it myself. I took some hints from <a href="http://anoved.net/2007/11/pdftk-141-for-intel-macs/">anoved.net</a> who was nice enough to also provide a compiled binary, but sadly did not include the shared libraries it relies on.

Instead, I made an installer package that'll install pdftk itself as well as the handful of libraries you need into <code>/usr/local</code>. Once you ran this, you can open Terminal.app, and typing <code>pdftk</code> should greet you as follows:

<pre><code>$ pdftk
SYNOPSIS
       pdftk &lt;input PDF files | - | PROMPT&gt;
            [input_pw &lt;input PDF owner passwords | PROMPT&gt;]
            [&lt;operation&gt; &lt;operation arguments&gt;]
            [output &lt;output filename | - | PROMPT&gt;]
            [encrypt_40bit | encrypt_128bit]
(...)
</code></pre>

You can download the <ins datetime="2010-03-18T16:51:12+00:00">updated</ins> package here: <strong><a href="http://fredericiana.com/downloads/pdftk1.41_OSX10.6.dmg">pdftk1.41_OSX10.6.dmg</a></strong>

(MD5 hash: <code>ea945c606b356305834edc651ddb893d</code>)

I only tested it on OS X 10.6.2, if you use it on older versions, please let me know in the comments if it worked.
