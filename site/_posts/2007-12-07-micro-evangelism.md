Today I sent a support request to the computer pool admins at my university's CS school, so they <strong>upgrade Firefox to version 2</strong> any time soon. The Fedora Core instances on these boxes are still on Fx 1.5.12. 

I mean, it's only <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/mozilla-2006-10-24.html">been out for a year</a> and Firefox 1.5's lifetime <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=21543">has ended for half a year</a> now, so that sounds like it's about time for an update.

Interestingly though, the Fedora Project seems to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Firefox2">keep version 1.5 until they can switch to 3.0</a> (therefore completely skipping Firefox 2). And unless I am mistaken, the pool computers still run FC&nbsp;6. So my request may not be successful after all. But unless Fedora backports security patches to the 1.5 branch (which may arguably be more work than just switching to Firefox 2?) I strongly oppose keeping unsupported software versions for any significant time. Especially in a university setting with hundreds of users happily surfing the web on a daily basis. And especially for a web browser, which by definition constantly gets its hands dirty with possibly harmful code.

Let's see what they say -- I sure hope it'll be more useful than your average <em>"just boot into Windows, then"</em>...

<strong>Update:</strong> Just about half a second after I blogged this, the pool people answered that Fedora still backports patches into Firefox 1.5, and soon (that is, once Fedora drops support for version 6), the pool computers will get an upgrade to FC&nbsp;8, which will also contain Firefox 2 then.

Excellent.
