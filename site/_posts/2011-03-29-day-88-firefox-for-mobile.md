Today we released <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/mobile/">Firefox 4 for Mobile</a>, available on the Android and Maemo platforms. It combines all the awesomeness of Firefox 4 into one small package. If you have an Android (or Maemo) phone, hop on over to <a href="http://firefox.com/m/">firefox.com</a> and give it a try!

In the picture: Cheng, of Mozilla Support fame, using Firefox on a gigantic (borrowed) Nexus S phone. Yes, the touch screen really works, and yes, it is really running an instance of the Android operating system with a real version of Firefox for Mobile. It's awesome!
