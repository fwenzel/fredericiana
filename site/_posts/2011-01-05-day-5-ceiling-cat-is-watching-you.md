This real-life version of a <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ceiling-cat">well-known Internet meme</a> was one of the Christmas tree toppers at the Mozilla offices this past Christmas. (Anyone know who made it?). When the trees were removed, brave souls saved the toppers from what seemed to be their sealed fate and put them up on display in different spots in the office.

This is a highest-quality cellphone pic taken with Vignette, with the "toy camera" filter applied. I like the graininess and dark corners that came out as a result.
