A man at the farmer's market, meticulously selecting the right cherry tomatoes.

I'm a fan of candid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_photography">street photography</a> -- though I haven't engaged in it a whole lot before. That's mostly because I find it takes a little more effort to find good subjects and take a picture in just the right moment, making it hard to take good shots while out and about for a different purpose or when not alone. In addition, I want to make reasonably sure that the subject does not notice me, or the shot wouldn't be candid anymore. So holding a full-blown DSLR into people's faces isn't the best way to do that.
