<a href="http://www.greenstormfilm.com/">Greenstorm Film</a> is an independent production company from Moscow, Idaho. They make great short films, such as this one, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-bGOwNgKDI">"The Package"</a>:

I find this really funny :). There's another one, more grotesque but no less amusing: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCryKx9XcZc">The Great Couch Caper.</a>

I like how creative these guys are, and how well they put everything in scene. Another example of their talent is this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEZo-fLtWQA">music video</a> of a cover version of "Airplanes" by B.o.B. (which, by the way, also features some really good musicians!)

And now that I've hooked you up on their filmmaking, you'll be pleased to know they are working on a feature-length film named <a href="http://theprotagonist.greenstormfilm.com/">"The Protagonist"</a> (<a href="http://vimeo.com/4019434">trailer</a>), due to be released in the fall. I, for one, can't wait to see it.
