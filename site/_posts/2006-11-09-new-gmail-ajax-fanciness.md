So, a few minutes ago, the Google <strong>GMail interface</strong> changed (again ;)) and has become even more "ajaxy":

<img id="image129" src="/media/wp/2006/11/gmail-dropdown.jpg" alt="GMail Interface with dropdown list" class="center" />

The common operations are now a dropdown list in the upper right corner of the displayed message, for example.

So far, I like it. What do you guys think?
