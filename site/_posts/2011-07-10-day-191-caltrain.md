This is a Caltrain, as it is leaving Mountain View station, southbound.

Turns out, fisheye lenses are great for things like trains. However, I also realize this is hopelessly overexposed. I'm going to need to continue tweaking the settings until I know what my camera does with a fully manual lens it can't talk to.
