One of my wife's friends is teaching English to Ukrainian kids, and she sent me this excellent comment today:

<blockquote>One of my students told me today that <strong>"Mozilla" in Ukrainian</strong> does not sound like a very nice word. He said it sounds like a person who is a very bad at shooting arrows. In other words.... a stupid and <strong>inept archer</strong>. Just thought you should know.</blockquote>

We are lucky implementing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey_%28JavaScript_engine%29">JÃ¤gerMonkey</a> did not require extensive experience with bow and arrow I guess?
