Lots has happened since the last time I posted -- I got married, for example. Once the professional photographer gets back to us with the pictures, I might even share some ;)

Today, however, I am able to introduce someone else to you, dear readers: Meet <strong>Lizzy!</strong>

Lizzy is a mixed breed, part (Miniature) Schnauzer, part unknown. The young lady is about 1 year and 3 months old, and Tara and I got her from an animal protection association, where she was dropped off by a family that suddenly decided they didn't want a dog anymore... She is very well behaved, hardly ever barks, and after a few moments of shyness, loves just about anyone she meets.

Tara and I are very happy to have adopted her and are gladly sharing our apartment now :)
