Meet Seth, during his first day back at the office after an extended stay abroad. They must not have been feeding him pretty well there, since this is what it looked like, ten minutes after he noticed three pristine cakes on the counter. In the picture, he is getting ready to move on to dessert.

(All right, I kid, I kid. In fact, today was February birthday cake day at Mozilla! What an excellent first day to come back on!)
