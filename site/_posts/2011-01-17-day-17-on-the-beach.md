Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day" rel="nofollow">MLK, Jr. Day</a>. Since it's a day off, we went on a trip to the Pacific Coast, to Santa Cruz. This is a photo of Tara and Lizzy running on the "off-leash dog beach". Fun!

At ISO 400 and f/11, my camera kept up with the action very well. I like the colors from the sunset.
