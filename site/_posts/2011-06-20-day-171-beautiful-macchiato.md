No need to bash that well-known coffee house chain from Seattle in this context, since they do a lot of things right, but in a place like Portland, Oregon, it would be plain sad to visit that one over the many excellent local coffee shops the city has to offer.

Like <a href="http://baristapdx.com/">Barista</a>, in Pearl District, where I got this prime specimen of a Macchiato, which tasted as phenomenal as it looks.
