I know what you're thinking -- what drugs is he on now, posting a picture with almost no subject, just traffic lights and the sky? Well yeah, fair point. But just look at how blue and cloudless the Californian sky is today. Woooah. Reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence">Provence</a>, where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_%28wind%29">Mistral</a> makes short work of the clouds, leaving behind nothing but a beautifully clear, blue sky just like this.

Also, for the record, I did not crank up the saturation on this photo. It is how it is.
