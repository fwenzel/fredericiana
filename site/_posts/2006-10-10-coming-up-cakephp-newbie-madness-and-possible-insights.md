Just as a little warning beforehand:

I will probably be blogging on web application development with <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> a bit in the near future. As mentioned before, I started working at <a href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> recently, and the current project I am on happens to be written in PHP using the CakePHP web development framework.

I have to admit: Though the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC design pattern</a> is pretty well known (and well-taught everywhere), actually using it exclusively (pretty much no exceptions) takes a little bending my mind and makes me want to cry sometimes.

It's not <em>that</em> complicated, but, well, it's different.

So stay tuned for the little weird things I might come across on my journey through the bakery.
