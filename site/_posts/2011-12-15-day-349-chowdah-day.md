Today, I decided it was <strong>Chowdah</strong> (sic) <strong>Day</strong>, a tradition started long ago by the fine folks at the <a href="http://osuosl.org">OSU Open Source Lab</a>, where every Friday was Chowdah Day. The smart folks among you will helpfully remark that today is not, in fact, a Friday, but it would also be customary I have the dish in the right place with the right people and with a drop or two of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholula_Hot_Sauce">Cholula</a>, so sadly the weekday isn't the only tradition I had to break with today.

Without all of the right circumstances in place, of course it is not quite the same. The Chowder, however, was delicious, also thanks to the world's biggest pepper grinder that I conveniently borrowed from Mozilla's kitchen.
