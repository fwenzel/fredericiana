Here is what Twitter told me *after* I sent the confirmation code by SMS:

<img src="/media/wp/2009/04/twitter-no-sms.jpg" alt="Twitter: No SMS" title="Twitter: No SMS" width="558" height="193" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2164" />

Of course, they couldn't have figured out that they don't like my cell phone number <strong>before</strong> I had to send a for-pay message to their German message service.

The same thing happened to me with Twitter in the US already as well. I am a "pre-paid" customer there, and I was similarly told that I am unable to use Twitter on the phone in the US.

I seriously wonder what I've done wrong to be excluded from Twitter's phone service in *two* countries. What's going on?
