Since I filled up my Netflix queue on the weekend and they only ship DVDs on weekdays, my Netflix queue said

<blockquote>We'll send your first available movie on <strong>Monday</strong>.</blockquote>

all weekend long.

Now I just looked at the queue to see if it shipped, and now it says:

Uhm, Netflix, what's going on? I've heard rumors before that you stretch out DVD shippings in order to reduce the amount of DVDs per month and customer, but do you need to do so with a new customer and his <strong>first DVD</strong>?

Then again, maybe they haven't survived their <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/26200588">huge shipping issues</a> from last week quite yet, in spite of my entire queue saying "Availability: Now".

It depends on your individual definition of <em>"now"</em>, after all.

<strong>Update:</strong> Interesting, Netflix sent me an email apologizing about the bad start of my membership, extending my free trial for a week. Well then.
