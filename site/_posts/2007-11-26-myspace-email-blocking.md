Today, I received my first MySpace invitation spam ever, featuring some text along the lines of:

<blockquote>Hi gorgeous i loved your profile
you want to have great time... <em>blah, blah...</em></blockquote>

Sadly for her, I am not a MySpace member and probably never will, but when I almost hit the <em>"Report Spam"</em> button, I realized that myspace has a <em>proactive approach</em> against spam from their members (also described in their <a href="http://collect.myspace.com/misc/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>). The end of the mail reads:

<blockquote>If you want to block any emails from MySpace members in the future, you can click here:

http://www1.myspace.com/...

Or send a single blank email with the subject line "BLOCK" to:

privacy (at) myspace (dot) com

You can also block future email or direct any other inquiries by regular postal mail to:

MySpace, Inc.
8391 Beverly Blvd. #349
Los Angeles, CA 90048
USA</blockquote>

After making sure the mail was not a phishing attack, I went to the provided link and put my address on MySpace's block list and now I am fairly confident this first invitation spam message will also have been my last.

As they tend to live off the sharing of private data, social networking sites almost never deserve praise for something they do privacy-related. This, I believe, is a notable exception.

(Note: A double opt-in system would be even better, yet that would defeat the purpose of "inviting one's friends" into a social network, who have not opted into the network (yet) by definition.)
