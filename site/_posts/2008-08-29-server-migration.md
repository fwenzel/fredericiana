Later tonight, the webserver this blog (and a bunch of other sites) runs on will be <a href="http://blog.jeanpierre.de/2008/08/28/preparing-to-move/">migrated to a new, bigger server</a>.

The main reason is that the old box ran out of RAM quite frequently lately (it is a virtual machine that has a flexible RAM limit). The cause of this was mainly the ever-increasing amount of spam, and in spite of the <a href="http://blog.jeanpierre.de/2008/08/12/fighting-spammers-back/">most recent counter-measures</a>, the little VM wasn't able to cope with it any longer. The new server has a bigger CPU, twice as much RAM guaranteed, and other improved features that make me confident that the change is the right step.

For you, dear readers, this means you may experience a few problems loading our websites while we are performing the migration (sorry) but we'll try to keep it to a minimum. You'll be rewarded with an even faster, nicer, and obviously awesomer fredericiana.com later. Thanks for your patience!
