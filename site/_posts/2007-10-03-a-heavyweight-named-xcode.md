Today I had to upgrade <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Apple's XCode</a> to the current version 2.4.1, because the old XCode 2.2 that came with my OSX install CDs resulted in <a href="http://www.nabble.com/ffmpeg---unable-to-install-t4551510.html">errors with some apps</a> (ffmpeg, in my case). The XCode installation package weighs in at <strong>924 Megabytes</strong>, just a little short of one Gigabyte. Slim is not one of the words I would use for that...

And all that just to <a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/macports/wiki/InstallingMacPorts">install Macports</a>, my favorite tool to bring the most powerful Unix tools to OSX. 

At least their download servers are pretty darn fast -- that eases the pain:

I am just wondering: What do people do with a <strong>slow internet connection</strong> or a <strong>small harddrive</strong>?
