Oh, oh, I got hit by an Internet meme. Both <a href="http://www.reybango.com/index.cfm/2009/1/15/7-Things-You-May-Or-May-Not-Know-About-Me">Rey</a> and <a href="http://adblockplus.org/blog/now-it-got-me-as-well">Wladimir</a> demand my participation, and by the laws of teh Internets&trade; I shall comply.

<strong>Seven things:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I am slightly <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness">color blind</a></strong> (my uneducated guess would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteranomaly#Anomalous_trichromacy">"deuteranomaly"</a>, or mild green weakness). It's apparently the most common form of colorblindness, affecting about 6% of males, and I have no considerable problems because of it. Except it may make me not the ideal person to ask about the color combination of clothes (which may arguably be a blessing). I've known since the medical exam before elementary school, yet at the military exam, the woman testing my eyes thought she was making a great discovery and shouted out <em>"you are colorbind!!!"</em> -- I yawned.</li>
	<li>I learned to <strong>read</strong> well before attending elementary school while I was still in kindergarten. (Don't know how others do it, but in Germany, at least at that time, it wasn't taught before first grade). I picked it up out of curiosity from my brother who is two years older and went to school already.</li>
	<li>I took <strong>Latin</strong> all the way from 5th through 13th grade. It was one of my two advanced courses for graduation (the other one was Math), and I am unsure how, but I got an A+ for both the written and oral exam. Needless to say it didn't end up being particularly relevant in college, nonetheless it was fun and I'd do it again. And no, I cannot actually <em>speak</em> Latin.</li>
	<li>I have been playing the <strong>trumpet</strong> since I was 14 years old. It's one of my favorite things to do yet I got to do it way too little lately due to writing my master's thesis. I've played in a number of groups: orchestral, big band, and in a trumpet quartet. Some of the most fun but also most exhausting gigs were at the yearly congresses of the Association of Catholic Fraternities in Germany, with hundreds of attendees.</li>
	<li>I do not have a particular <strong>accent</strong> in German: While I have lived in south-western Germany all my life, my parents are not from there, and theirs isn't very strong, so I didn't pick up a particularly distinct accent. Nonetheless up until this day, I still get asked <em>"you are not from here, are you?"</em> at home sometimes, particularly by the elderly. The closest I have to a <strong>dialect</strong> however is indeed from south-west Germany, which I sometimes notice when I use apparent localisms too freely elsewhere in Germany and earn question marks in return (food items seem to differ the most!).</li>
	<li>I have more than only remotely considered studying <strong>law</strong>. I ended up studying <a href="http://informationswirtschaft.de/en/ueb/teaser1">information engineering</a> instead, as it looked like a great middle ground between law and my big hobby, computers (with some business thrown in, for good measure): It's 40&nbsp;% computer science, 40&nbsp;% business and 20&nbsp;% law. And in fact, I loved studying this, and the law classes were my favorites, hands down. What I didn't realize until later is that as opposed to <em>real</em> future lawyers, we got the <em>interesting</em> topics only. Awesome!</li>
	<li>I attended three <strong>universities</strong>: <a href="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.oregonstate.edu">Oregon State University</a> and <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, all to finish this one degree. Curiously, the only one I paid tuition for was/is KIT, luckily also the cheapest.</li>
