Just recently I ranted about <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/06/05/dear-gmail/">how bad it is that GMail auto-adds every possible email address</a> it can get its hands on to your contacts, making them utterly cluttered with the most random people on the planet, including "remove me from this mailinglist" addresses and others you never want to see again.

It seems as if Google heard me (and many others): They now introduced a new section <strong>"suggested contacts"</strong> that they dump everybody and their brother's email address into, but the people you actually want to have as contacts stay in an also newly created "My Contacts" folder.

This gives you the convenience of still adding people you email to the auto-complete feature (which, in and by itself is not so bad), while not hopelessly cluttering your contacts. Exactly what I want!

Well, thank you, Google. <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/updates-to-gmail-contact-manager.html">Read more about it on the GMail blog.</a>
