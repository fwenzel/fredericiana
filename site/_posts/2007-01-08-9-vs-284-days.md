As "Washington Post" blogger Brian Krebs <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/01/internet_explorer_unsafe_for_2.html">calculated</a>, MS Internet Explorer was "unsafe" for <strong>284 days</strong> in 2006. (And by "unsafe", he means "with known, yet unpatched, security holes"). That's <strong>more than 75%</strong> of the year.

In comparison, Mozilla Firefox experienced a single such <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=408603">period</a> of 9 days total in the same time frame.

I really had no idea that the difference was so significant: I am stoked. (And I'm proud of the many hard-working Firefox contributors who do their best every day to make your browsing experience a safer). Good job!
