Filled with deep sadness I have to realize that I can't watch the games of the <strong>soccer world cup 2006 in Germany</strong> live on TV.

<blockquote>Why? They are on, aren't they?</blockquote>

Ah, well, yes. But they are on around noonish, and at work, we don't have cable, so I am stuck with taping them and watching them later. Which is not even remotely as spicey as watching a game live.

However, I can probably be sure that I won't meet anyone all day who cares about the world cup, so at least nobody will spoil it for me ;) Back home in Germany, it wouldn't take any more than like 10 minutes until somebody cheered outside, telling you who won.

Especially when it was the German team who won.

By the way, if you are into betting on sports events but don't really want to spend money, try <a href="http://www.stoccer.de/index.php?id=6&L=3">Stoccer</a>. It is a market research project from my <a href="http://uni-karlsruhe.de">home university</a> back in Germany and it works like a stock market for national team "stocks". They try to predict who'll win the world cup from analyzing what users "buy" what teams. Sounds like fun, I think I will join it!
