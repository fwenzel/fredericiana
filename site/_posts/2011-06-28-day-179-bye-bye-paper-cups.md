For the longest time, there was exactly one espresso cup available for me to have my daily espresso with -- if someone else dared to have one before me, off to the paper cups it was! Too bad that espresso from a paper cup never tastes particularly good...

Luckily, Mozilla has the best office team ever, so after a short email and a little bit of waiting, six shiny new cups showed up in the kitchen. Woot and thanks a lot!
