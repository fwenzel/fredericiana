The Gilroy Garlic Festival (in the self-proclaimed "garlic capital of the world") is the destination an annual pilgrimage of garlic lovers from near and far. Some would say, eating (almost) exclusively garlicky food in the glaring summer sun is a bad idea, but obviously those would just be disbelievers. Plus, they had garlic ice cream, too ;)
