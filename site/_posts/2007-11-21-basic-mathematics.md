Part of a conversation I overheard in the dining hall today, apparently between two maybe third-semester computer scientists:

<blockquote>These <em>information engineers</em> are the worst! I have met them in my CS 2 class! They ask the weirdest questions and they don't even know <strong>basic mathematics</strong>!</blockquote>

Despite the insult, this amused me. Silly boy, believing anyone here hasn't been tortured with "basic mathematics" for a significant amount of time ;)
