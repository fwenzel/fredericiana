After last week's overexposed shot, time to try again with the shutter speed increased a little. Worked well, I think! Admittedly, it's a cloudy day, so the risk of overexposure is slim anyway.

This is a "fake HDR" (single shot, tonemapped) shot, which I liked for the nicely increased contrast on the clouds as well as the letters on the sign.
