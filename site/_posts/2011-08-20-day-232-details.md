Fiat really made sure to make its "nuova 500" a work of art. There are plenty of details like this all around. The headlights, by the way, much like the brakes, suspension, tanks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fiat_500_%282007%29&oldid=445190470#United_States_.26_Canada">etc. etc.</a>, were reworked to please the American market (and adhere to local vehicle safety codes). Much to my delight, as the changes seem to have overall resulted in a much better version of the car (with the exception of the taillight design, perhaps).
