Design Agency <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/">"Information Architects"</a> from Tokyo has released a <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/ia-trendmap-2007v2">tube map of the Web</a> (for the second time, even), connecting the allegedly "200 most successful sites on the web":

<a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/ia-trendmap-2007v2"><img src='/media/wp/2007/07/webtrends-map.jpg' alt='Part of the WebTrends Map 2007 v2' /></a>

The map (<a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/slash/iA_WebTrends_2007_2_1600x1024.gif">large version here</a>) seems to have shrunk Firefox's "station" a little, compared to the <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/webtrends2007">first version of the map</a> released around new year's. I hardly even found it at first.

While I may not agree with all of the inclusions or connections (for example, I am unsure why the awfully overrated German weblog "Spreeblick" belongs on there) I think it's an interesting and fun map to look at (rather than an accurate illustration of the current structure of the web).
