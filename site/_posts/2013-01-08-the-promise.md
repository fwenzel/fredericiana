First, she'd put her children to sleep. Only then she put on her heels, her skimpy outfit, and way too much makeup. She didn't want them to see her like that.

She had only one intention: Make enough to feed the kids tomorrow, maybe even rent. Get it over with, get home safe, and wash off the sweat, the smell of cheap cologne. The shame and disgust.

As she turned the key in the lock, she promised herself: Tomorrow they would leave this town for good.

Just like she did every night.

This week's challenge was to write 33 to 333 words about:

[INTENTION (noun)][mw-intention]
[mw-intention]: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intention
**3 a: what one intends to do or bring about**<br>**b: the object for which a prayer, mass, or pious act is offered**

I am planning on [blogging about once a week in 2013][challenge]. In this context, this is one of my first-ever attempts at *writing [fiction][fiction]*. Let me know what you think of the story in the comments, but keep that in mind :)
