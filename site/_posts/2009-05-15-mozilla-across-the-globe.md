My colleague Dave made a little Google Maps mashup, illustrating <a href="http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2009/05/Where-are-we-all">where in the world Mozilla employees are</a>. The result is quite an impressive map:

<a href="http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2009/05/Where-are-we-all"><img src="/media/wp/2009/05/mozilla-employees-international-575x375.jpg" alt="Mozilla Employees International" title="Mozilla Employees International" width="575" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2233" /></a>

Over at Dave's blog, you can actually zoom in to see more closely where people are. The one in Munich, Germany, is yours truly, by the way.
