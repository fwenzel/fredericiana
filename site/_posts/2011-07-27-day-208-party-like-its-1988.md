I know. Photographically there's so much wrong with this (for example, can my cell phone get a polarizing filter, please?) but the subject is pretty awesome.

In a place where there are usually advertisements for boring present-day products, today I saw this vintage poster advertising reduced transfer rates during the <strong>holiday season 1988</strong> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley_Transportation_Authority">Santa Clara County Transportation Agency</a>, as the predecessor of the VTA was called back then.

Epic, epic. As the poster was not explained at all but looked like an original (faded ink, yellowed paper), I am wondering how it got there. Not sure if I'd be bold enough to take an original out of the archives and stick it into a showcase by a train stop, hoping no-one will steal it. Well, let's hope everyone just enjoys it from a distance.
