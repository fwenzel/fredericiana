As you may have noticed, I was taking some "time off" from the daily photo-taking-and-uploading after 365 consecutive days of that exercise in 2011. But of course, the photos I take <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/12/13/project-365-whats-next/">can't just go unpublished</a>, so I discussed it with my fellow photography nerd morgamic, and we decided to start a photo blog together! It's called <strong>Overexpose Me</strong> and lives under the catchy domain name <a href="http://overexpose.me">overexpose.me</a>.

I am planning on posting a new picture or two per week, depending on what photo opportunities I come across. I also installed a widget into the sidebar of this blog, showing you the latest and greatest additions to the photo blog.

We hope you'll enjoy looking at the pictures as much as we liked taking them! Let us know what you think!
