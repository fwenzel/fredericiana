This is the Milpitas Fire Department's Training Facility: A big concrete building that they can set on fire, then extinguish as a training exercise. Which is pretty awesome. Let's all just hope this knowledge is applicable to the actual buildings in the city which are, well, all <strong>not</strong> made of concrete. :)
