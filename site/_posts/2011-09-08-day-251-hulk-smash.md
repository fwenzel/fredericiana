Some of the conference rooms at the office have a wireless Audio/Video panel from which you can control the phone, video conferencing, etc. -- recently, I put one of these panels back onto their holder, and of course, it broke off :-/ It had apparently been broken and glued back together before and the glue had come back off. In good Mozilla fashion, of course this resulted in a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=682403">bug report</a> being filed, and because, as the old saying goes, the laugh is always on the loser, there was promptly a dramatization of events attached to said bug:

Meanwhile, the A/V panel stand is fixed and has a nice little message "please be gentle" attached to it. Well, at least it's not carrying my name ;)
