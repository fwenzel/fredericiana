The fabulous Tarek Ziadé started a ["New Year's Python meme"][meme] a few years ago. This is the first time I am joining the fun. Here you go:

## 1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2012?

[PyObjC][pyobjc]. No, seriously. Perhaps "discovered" is a strong word, as I knew that library existed. But this year was the first time I tried writing a Mac application in Python. Despite the somewhat [horrendous syntax][no-pep8], I was very pleased with the results and I have since released the first version of [UpShot][upshot] (an automatic screenshot uploader).

[pyobjc]: http://packages.python.org/pyobjc/
[no-pep8]: https://github.com/fwenzel/upshot/blob/6cc10a4/lib/utils.py#L51
[upshot]: http://upshot.it

## 2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012?

Not sure if this counts as a "programming technique" per se, but I spent a lot of time figuring out the differences between "traditional" web programming and making **HTML5/JS/CSS-driven apps for Boot2Gecko** (soon to be Firefox OS). Making apps that are supposed to run as well offline (disconnected from the server) as online poses interesting challenges, so I learn about a number of new and established APIs I never used before.

## 3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What did you do?

Various parts of the **Mozilla Apps** project. I only sometimes write code, and more often I make sure that other engineers get to spend their time coding rather than in meetings. In the end, we make great tools, tutorials and other resources for other developers to make apps.

## 4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012?

I actually get a lot of my Python-related news by following the "right" people on Twitter (including lots of great Python devs I work with). I also check out reddit/r/Python on occasion.

## 5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013?

Oh hey, I should probably know that by now, considering the new year starts tomorrow? Let's see.

Next year, I'd love to get better at *Writing*, *JavaScript*, and *Cooking*. All of which I am not exactly horrible at, but still have a lot to learn about.

## 6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2013?

I would love for [UpShot][upshot] to get a more solid user base including some contributors. It might just be (one of) the only open source screenshot sharing software out there, and I'd love to build a small community around it.

I think it would be fantastic if someone contributed a feature like uploading to different sharing services.
