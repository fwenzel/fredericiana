Houses in Lyon, France, reflecting in the smooth waters of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhone">Rhone river</a>.

There has been little rainfall lately, resulting in low water levels and almost no motion in the water. This makes for tons of algae in the water (ewww) but also pretty reflections like this.
