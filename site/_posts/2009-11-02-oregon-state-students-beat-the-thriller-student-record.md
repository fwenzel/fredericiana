This is just awesome: This Halloween, <strong>638 students</strong> from Oregon State University <a href="http://media.barometer.orst.edu/media/storage/paper854/news/2009/11/02/News/thriller.College.Record.Broken.By.Osu.Community-3819718.shtml">beat the college record of the most students performing Michael Jackson's "Thriller</a>" at Reser Stadium, Corvallis, Oregon.

Over 600 people was way more than the previous (student) record:

<blockquote>The previous college record was set at the College of William and Mary in Richmond, Va., where 242 people participated in the dance routine that student Kevin Dua organized. Dua's group beat the previous record of 147 people in an event at a British secondary school.</blockquote>

Here is the official footage of the event:

Of course, this has not been the first attempt to spectacularly perform this music video. Here's another video of a group of prisoners doing the same thing:

Finally, if you want to get a fix of the real thing, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxI_Y7h4Q4">it's on youtube too</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong> As a commenter points out, the OSU admissions blog has <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/admissions/blog/2009/11/03/this-is-it-oregon-state-university-community-shatters-thriller-record/">blogged the whole thing too</a>, and provided some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA1Y-ts6FiI&feature=player_embedded">HD-quality video</a> of the event, which I have replaced the old video with.
