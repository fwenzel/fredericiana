title: An Easter Egg for mozilla.org
---

There was a time when I worked on the website [mozilla.org][mozorg] full time. This time has passed, but the website is in the capable hands of my friends at Mozilla's Web Productions team.

Still, I [landed a patch][bug] the other day, and a fun one at that: When you "View Source" on [www.mozilla.org][mozorg], you'll be greeted with this:

This *easter egg* is a hat tip to our [dino mascot][mascot], and a friendly invitation for the kind of people who *View Source* all the time to come join us.

Hope you like it!

PS: It also shows up in one more place besides the page source. *Can you find it?*

I'm trying—and failing—to [blog about once a week in 2013][challenge], on various topics. This is my sixteenth post of the year.
