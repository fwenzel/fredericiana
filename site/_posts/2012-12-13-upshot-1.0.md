title: UpShot 1.0 with Custom Domain Support
---

I am proud to announce **release 1.0 of UpShot**, my automatic screenshot uploader for OS X! Lots of news to share, buckle up!

## Custom Domain Support

First things first: As [promised][upshot-post], UpShot now supports using your own custom domain name with Dropbox. You need to [set up your domain to support it][custom-domain], but then UpShot is happy to use it.

[custom-domain]: /2012/12/09/custom-domain-with-dropbox/

Check out the new preferences window with the domain setting at the bottom:

Impatient? [Head over to upshot.it][upshot.it] and download version 1.0 right now!

## Wait what, upshot.it?

With the recent, unfortunate [removal of file uploads from Github][ex-uploads], I had to put the release files for UpShot elsewhere. So I decided to put my money where my mouth is, get a domain name and actually make a website for UpShot.

This is [upshot.it][upshot.it]!

The new website will always have the latest (and previous) releases to download.

## Stay up to date on UpShot

I wanted to make it easier for people to stay up to date with the development of UpShot, so I created a Twitter account for it as well: **[@UpShot_it][tw]**.

**Follow [@UpShot_it][tw] on Twitter now!**

As you may remember, auto-updating the software is [on the roadmap][auto-update-issue] for UpShot, but not implemented yet. So this is also the best way to stay up to date with new releases of UpShot!
