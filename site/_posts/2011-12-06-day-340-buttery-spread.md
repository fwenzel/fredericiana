Artificially flavored "The Colonel's Buttery Spread"? Eeeew. That's nasty. I <em>can</em> believe it's not butter!

I am constantly baffled by the US food industry's ability to butcher perfectly fine foods and replace them with nasty artificial products. Why eat butter if you can have "buttery spread"? Why cheese, since there's Velveta? Gross, I say. Gross.
