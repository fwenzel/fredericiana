No offense to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Burke">Cheryl Burke</a>, but I have a distinct suspicion that what makes the person in this photo so unnaturally skinny may well be Photoshop, not an ominous <em>appetite control spray</em>. Perhaps, if they wrote on the box how disturbingly photoshopped many photos of alleged "diet models" are, that would spoil people's appetite much more thoroughly than any diet product ever could.
