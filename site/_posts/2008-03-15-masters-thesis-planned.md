Awesome: Later this year, I will spend a few months doing research and writing my masters thesis as a grad student in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>.

It took a few months to get a handful of question marks out of the way, but now I am quite confident that it will work out just fine.

A lot of people may have heard the name Carnegie Mellon before, but for those who haven't, CMU is a private university with a good computer science program. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University">Wikipedia</a>, the college is pretty decently ranked and was <em>"named one of the "New <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League">Ivies</a>" by the magazine Newsweek in 2006"</em>.

Having been to the American East Coast only once before (on vacation to New York City), I am excited to see what the differences and similarities are between life there and what I experienced in Oregon and California. Oh, and if you happen to know Pittsburgh and around and would like to suggest something I certainly shouldn't miss out on when I'm there, please drop me a line :)
