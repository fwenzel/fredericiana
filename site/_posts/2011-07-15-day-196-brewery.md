People taking a brewery tour at the microbrewery "21st Amendment" in San Francisco. Thank heavens for the helpful label on the window, or I might have had trouble telling what I am looking at.

Now, the same brewing space we're looking at here featured a disco ball later, which is pretty awesome, I must admit.
