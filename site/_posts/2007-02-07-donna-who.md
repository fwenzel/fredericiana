While I was traveling, my mailbox filled up with a few letters, one from the <a href="http://osufoundation.org/">OSU Foundation</a> who I asked to resend their letter because I never received the one they sent me in 2006.

Now I am pretty sure I know why I never got it, because this is how the address part of the letter looks like:

<a href='/media/wp/2007/02/frederick-and-donna.jpg' title='Frederick and Donna'><img src='/media/wp/2007/02/frederick-and-donna.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Frederick and Donna' /></a>

Even if I -- friendly as I am -- ignore the multiple misspellings of my first name and the random middle initial, one question remains: Who is this mysterious <strong>Donna Wenzel</strong>?

(As a side note I wonder if there is actually an quasi-namesake out there somewhere who they confused me with.)
