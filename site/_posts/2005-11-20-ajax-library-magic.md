I just read about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Ajax/lib/CGI/Ajax.pm">CGI::Ajax</a> for Perl and was curious if there was something like it for PHP already?

And, look what's there, an alpha version of a <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_AJAX/">PEAR AJAX library</a> was released just this week.

Cool. We should have an eye on this as it could make AJAX stuff in PHP much, much easier.
