So, <strong>Wordpress on the iPhone</strong> is pretty cool. Obviously, typing an entire blog post on there can become tedious, but if you just want to tell the world about something that happened to you five seconds ago, it's definitely a must-have.

On the iPod, sadly, you don't have a camera, so you're stuck with text-only posts (unless you want to spend an hour typing HTML code). But who cares: aren't these things supposed to be nothing more than a music player anyway?
