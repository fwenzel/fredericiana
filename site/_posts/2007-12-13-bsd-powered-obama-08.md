Douglas Karr at the Marketing Technology blog has an interesting <a href="http://www.douglaskarr.com/2007/06/23/2008-elections-by-server/">post about the web servers the election candidates for the U.S. in 2008 run</a>.

Hillary runs Windows 2003, for example, while Guiliani trusts his website to a CentOS+Apache install. An exception seem to be Barrack Obama and C. Todd, who are the only ones to run FreeBSD on their webservers.

The percentage difference between Linux/Apache (48%) and Windows/IIS (43%), seems to reflect the Internet not <em>too</em> badly (which is <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html">about 50% Apache vs. 35% IIS</a>), but when you look at the two parties, there is a much more clear bias:

<blockquote>It’s fascinating to me that the Dems are predominantly Open Source… except for Hillary Clinton and the Republicans are predominantly Microsoft with the exception of Ron Paul, Jim Gilmore, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney.</blockquote>

I wonder what makes Republican candidates go so strongly for closed source products, but I'll leave this up to your speculations ;) .

When I look at the hosting companies, I don't recognize many names -- only one came to sight: Republican candidate Jim Gilmore gets his Linux box from 1&1 Internet, Inc., a subsidiary of <em>1 und 1</em>, one of Germany's largest internet companies who have big facilities in my university town Karlsruhe. /me waves from here.

Will this knowledge influence where the average geek's makes their cross on the ballot? Probably (or rather, hopefully) not. Yet it is interesting to see what technologies the candidates trust into. Now I'd only like to find out which <strong>browser</strong> they are using. But this will likely remain unresolved forever...
