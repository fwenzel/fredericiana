I even hope you will.

But can you survive in the <em>fatherland</em>? The German <em>Spiegel ("mirror") Magazine</em> put together a German <a href="http://www1.spiegel.de/active/survivalbible/fcgi/survivalbible.fcgi">survival bible</a> for you to practice your German social skills.

Have fun!
