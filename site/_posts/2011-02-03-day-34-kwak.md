This is <a href="http://morgamic.com">morgamic</a>. He's focusing the prey right before attacking a fine little Belgian brew called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauwel_Kwak">Kwak</a>. I like the hourglass-shaped beer glass, and that it comes with a wooden stand to keep it from tipping over. Belgian beers are known for their extravagant glasses -- and their hidden strength that'll knock your socks off before you can tell what happened. As a German, color me impressed.
