If there was an award for the largest company with the most unusable website, I would consider recommending <strong>T-Mobile</strong> for the award.

The American cellphone branch of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Telekom">German Telekom</a> obviously doesn't like its compatriots in the U.S. - or maybe they don't like their customers at all.

One might guess, ordering some new minutes for a prepaid cellphone card should be a common task. Far from it! Not only that I had to switch from Firefox to MSIE (and this <em>hurts</em>, believe me) because the "okay" button didn't show up (MSIE shows a big red cross meaning "image not found" that you can click instead). When I proceeded entering my data, the page was reloaded with every click on one of the numerous dropdown fields, constantly reminding me of the fact that there are securely encrypted and unencrypted parts of the page mixed. - <em>*click* no, I do not want to display insecure parts of the page</em>.

After I finally entered my whole address - the German one, using the dropdown box to select Germany, then, after another reload, selecting the only state "other - German" in the <em>State</em> dropdown box - a nice little Javascript information insists on: "Please choose a valid state".

So I have to go back and re-enter all the information again with an American address and I wonder if <em>anyone</em> has <em>ever</em> tested the site before making it available on the net.

Wow. This can't be coincidence. T-Mobile must virtually have spent a tremendous amount of money to build a website with <em>so many</em> obvious errors that it <em>must</em> be intentional. I seldomly got pissed off as much by a company website as today.
