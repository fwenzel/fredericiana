When taking our dog on a walk, we come by some really nice cars. Like this one (A Mercedes -- thus the "K" in "Kompressor"). Why they are parked outside, I am not sure: Either the owners want to show them off. Or they can't fit them into their two-car garages because two thirds of it are taken up by their everyday vehicle (<em>Yukon XL</em>, anyone?) and the other third is spent on random storage. Or both?

I begin to love the 50mm prime lens as my primary lens. I have to employ my "foot zoom" <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">alot</a>, but it takes fantastic pictures.
