The Hyatt Regency in Atlanta, where PyCon is, has a huge atrium, and all the hotel rooms are on the galleries along the edges. It's all concrete and therefore looks a lot like 70s (or so) futuristic architecture (the transparent, but lit up elevators do an additional job at enforcing this impression). Besides that, it also reminds a lot of Star Wars' <strong><a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Senate">Galactic Senate</a></strong>, with hundreds of senators each in their own floating "VIP booth".
