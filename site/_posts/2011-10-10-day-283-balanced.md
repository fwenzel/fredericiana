I recently bought a scale that frankly looks like the kind of tool people in the movies use for their drug trade... I use it for slightly more boring purposes: Making sure I use a consistent amount of coffee per espresso shot. I go for approximately 10 grams per shot, which is pretty much half-way in between a standard (7 gram) and a double (14 grams) shot.
