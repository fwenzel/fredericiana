Those Caltrain Baby Bullet trains look mighty sleek there -- if they run. After the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_17287334?nclick_check=1">recent budget woes</a> threatened to keep most of these "babies" in the depot, some recently-found funding will at least keep them running <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_17935090?nclick_check=1">for another year</a>.
