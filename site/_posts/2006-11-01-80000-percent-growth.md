<strong>alexa</strong> -- a search engine that provides traffic rankings about web pages too -- currently lists the first five websites on their <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/movers_shakers?lang=en">"movers and shakers" list</a> from Mozilla.

This blog is ranked #6 with an <strong>80,000% growth</strong> and a weekly traffic rank of 4,277.

Chances are that's the <ins datetime="2006-11-02T19:12:30+00:00">one of the biggest growths</ins> Alexa has ever recorded for a single website :) -- I'm impressed!

Update: I am <strong>number 2</strong> now! :) The growth percentage has fallen to a less impressive 460% this week but I guess being higher in the list is nice too ;)
