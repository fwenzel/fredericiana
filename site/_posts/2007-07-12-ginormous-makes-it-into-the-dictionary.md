Hah, that's funny: The word <strong>"ginormous"</strong> made it into <a href="http://www.m-w.com/info/newwords07.htm">this year's update of the Merriam-Webster dictionary</a>, two years after it made first place in an online poll for the <em>"favorite word not in the dictionary"</em>.

They <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/ginormous">define it</a> as:

<blockquote>extremely large, HUMONGOUS</blockquote>

Awesome.

<strong>Update:</strong> As a reader points out, it only wasn't in Merriam-Webster (an <strong>American</strong> dictionary) yet -- while it has been <strong>British</strong> slang for a long time and thus can be found in the <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&freesearch=ginormous&branch=13842570&textsearchtype=exact">Oxford dictionaries</a>. Thanks, Ian!
