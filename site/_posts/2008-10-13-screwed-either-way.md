Today's xkcd comic boils down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Restrictions Management</a> dilemma to its core:

<a href="http://xkcd.com/488/"><img src="/media/wp/2008/10/steal_this_comic.png" alt="" title="&quot;Steal This Comic&quot;, CC by-nc licensed by Randall Munroe" width="498" height="469" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1700" /></a>

The latest Wal-Mart example--<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2008/09/wal-mart_latest_music_store_to.html">switching off their DRM servers</a> (in spite of their later decision <a href="http://consumerist.com/5061839/walmart-decides-to-honor-drm+protected-mp3-purchases-after-all-at-least-for-now">not to do it after all</a>)--has shown that companies are not willing to stand by their <strong>self-imposed</strong> duties of providing a DRM framework for many decades to come. Instead, they are taking away the technical possibility to play your files at their sole discretion, leaving you as a customer with no choice other than throw away your media collection--or violate the law.

This is why DRM is so bad: While it is understandable that companies want to protect their income sources, by demanding payment for the media they produced, DRM is making promises the companies do not <em>want to hold</em>, or in some cases (read: bankrupcy) <em>can't</em> hold. This is why I prefer, at least at the moment, Amazon MP3 over the DRMed part of iTunes any day of the week.

And while Wal-Mart does not exactly have a great reputation as a whole, there's one thing they've thoroughly understood: The concept of capitalism. So it comes to no surprise that they (along with Amazon, for example) <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/03/wal-mart-amazon-ratchet-up-anti-drm-pressure/">exert pressure on the music industry to be able to sell DRM-free music</a>. The market demands DRM-free digital media that can be owned like a record or a CD and slowly, very slowly, content providers are forced to acknowledge that.

I can't help but wonder, though, <em>is this development going to include digital video as well, any time?</em>
