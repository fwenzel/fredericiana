A common stereotype about the US is, if you can think it, no matter how odd it is, there's somebody in the USA who does it.

I apologize therefore that this country still manages to weird me out. Like in the case of the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/19/national/main3949353.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_3949353">Idahoan Politician who changed his only and legal name to "Pro-Life"</a> (as a way to express his opinions about abortion):

<blockquote>A Senate candidate has legally changed his name to <strong>Pro-Life</strong> and will appear on the ballot that way this year, state election officials say.

As Marvin Pro-Life Richardson, the organic strawberry farmer from Letha, 30 miles northwest of Boise, was denied the use of his middle name when he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2006 because the state's policy bars the use of <strong>slogans on the ballot</strong>.

Now, though, officials in the Idaho secretary of state's office say they have no choice because <strong>Pro-Life is his full and only name</strong>. He says he will run for the highest state office on the ballot every two years for the rest of his life, advocating murder charges for doctors who perform abortions and for women who obtain the procedure.</blockquote>

Incidentally, having seen an Idaho absentee ballot, I can confirm him showing up as "Pro-Life, a person formerly known as Marvin Richardson".

Ignoring his political agenda for a second: Are you kidding me? Big Superman fan? Name your kid "Kal-el". Into pork? Why not call the little fellow "I-love-bacon"? (Oops, now I gave <a href="http://bacongeek.com/about/">Scott</a> an idea for his next child). There's really nothing crazy enough not to be done over here. Wow.
