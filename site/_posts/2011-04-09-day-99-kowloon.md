<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/5604699799/" title="Day 99 - Kowloon by Fredâ€‹, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/5604699799_8555e9c39e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Day 99 - Kowloon"/></a>

Named after the peninsula of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon">Kowloon</a> in Hong Kong, China, this cocktail combines coffee and orange flavors to a quite delectable concoction:

1 measure Kahlua
1 measure Grand Marnier
3 measures orange juice

Shake with ice, and serve in a wine glass half full of crushed ice. Decorate with a slice of orange.

Now, in the photo you might notice that I shamelessly replaced Grand Marnier with Cointreau. Also, I had no orange for decoration. It was delicious nonetheless. So sue me ;)
