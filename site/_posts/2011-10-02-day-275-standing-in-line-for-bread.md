I know many people who would swear standing in line for bread was a Soviet Union kind of thing. But, lo and behold! It exists here too. In good American fashion, the mom-and-pop bakery business was largely extinct decades ago in favor of mass-produced, subpar bread replacement products from your friendly neighborhood supermarket. Even today it remains a challenge to find delicious baked goods in this corner of the world -- though there is a silver lining (especially in the vicinity of somewhat overpaid Silicon Valley hipsters aching for anything that sounds or looks "European"), like this bakery stand at the market, selling excellent traditional baked goods -- if only you're willing to wait in line.
