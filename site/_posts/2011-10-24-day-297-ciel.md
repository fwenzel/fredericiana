Came across this shop window decoration today: "Ciel, où sont mes lunettes?" -- <em>"Heaven! Where are my glasses?"</em> What the shocked 1950s house wive character does not know (or can't see, anyway) is that her husband is wearing them just to mess with her. He doesn't need glasses anymore since he got laser eye surgery 14 months ago. Though in the 50s, it was called Chisel Eye Surgery because instead of lasers they used crude chisels from the optometrists' wood shops.

Also, none of this is true. Who is this? Prank caller! Prank caller<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/quotes?qt=qt0447151">!</a>
