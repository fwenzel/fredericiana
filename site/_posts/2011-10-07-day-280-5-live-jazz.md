Yeah I know I posted a picture today already, but I liked this one too much to let it go. (Yup, my project, my rules.) Here's a half-day photo. We had dinner at a restaurant that turned out also to have some really good live jazz. It was a pianist and a bassist, both of whom weren't only good musicians but also looked kinda like Steve Jobs, so we dubbed them "the Steves".
