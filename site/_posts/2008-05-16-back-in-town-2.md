Long time no see, everybody. I was quite busy lately, and I also spent a few days on vacation in Krakow, Poland. But I am back now and getting ready for leaving to Pittsburgh soon. Here are some pictures of Krakow for your enjoyment (click!):

During the course of our stay, we also went to see the Auschwitz and Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial sites. I took some pictures there also:

I think these two flights to Krakow and back were the perfect "practice" for my upcoming intercontinental flight. By the way, I have to say, Poland having joined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement">Schengen</a> is awesome. Traveling all over Europe has never been that easy. Thumbs up for the European Union!
