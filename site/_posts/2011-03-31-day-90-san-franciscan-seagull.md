This is my first bird photo in Project 365, and a "portrait", no less! Taken during a cruise in the San Francisco Bay, the Seagull was flying along with the boat, probably to get any scraps that these odd humans might have to spare.

In the background, you see the skyline of the City of San Francisco. The most notable landmark in the picture is probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transamerica_Pyramid">Transamerica Pyramid</a> on the far left. I really like how this photo turned out. It might look like it's photoshopped, but rest assured it's not ;)
