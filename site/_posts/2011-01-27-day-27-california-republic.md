<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/5394612008/" title="Day 27 - California Republic by Fredâ€‹, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5211/5394612008_38a1586b15.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Day 27 - California Republic" /></a>

This is a bumper sticker I saw on a parked car today. As Wikipedia so nicely teaches me, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_California">Flag of California</a> is a reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Republic">Bear Flag Revolt of 1846</a>, four years before California became a state. The bear flag, however, was not legally made the state flag until 1911.

I find the flag to be relatively rarely used around here by private people, while the US flag is omnipresent. It seems, people have less of a need to declare their regional than their national affinity. (In Germany, this is quite different, but I'll save that story until a later photo. Bear with me.)

This is a 14mm wide-angle photograph, which is why you can nicely see the distortions at the edges. My wide-angle lense is stuck open at its maximum, f/3.5 aperture, so it doesn't take the sharpest pictures, but I still like it.
