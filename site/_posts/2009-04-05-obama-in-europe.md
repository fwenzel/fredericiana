US president Obama came to Europe this week for a number of "summits". The German part of the NATO 60-year anniversary was held in Baden-Baden in South West Germany.

Incidentally, my father works right across the street from where Obama's helicopter (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_One">"Marine One"</a>) landed, so he took a few photos of the helicopter arriving. <a href="http://seniorenlife.de/news/obama-landet-in-baden-baden-lichtental">Enjoy.</a>

<strong>Update:</strong> Here is the <a href="http://seniorenlife.de/medien/fotos/galerie/34">gallery with the rest of the pictures</a>, along with some pictures of an "Obama/NATO cake", one of the many products made in Baden-Baden for the occasion.
