<a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon">OSCON 2007</a> starts next week in Portland, Oregon. Now, Nat Torkington on O'Reilly Radar <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/07/oscon_bring_you.html">encourages people to record presentations there and youtube them afterwards</a>.

As I can't make it to Portland this year, I am very glad to hear that! I hope, a lot of the presentations will make it online for us to enjoy.

PS: If you don't have a camcorder, you may want to check if your digital camera can take videos (most do, actually). The quality will certainly be sufficient even so. (The only thing I am worried about it youtube's 100M upload restriction, which may not be enough depending on the length of a particular presentation.) Oh, and make sure you bring a tripod if you tend to get shaky holding a cam for too long ;)
