For quite a while now, I've been using a popular Wordpress plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/subscribe-to-comments/">"subscribe to comments"</a> on fredericiana. It allows people to request email notifications when further comments come in on an article they commented on themselves. As it turns out though, the plugin has an <a href="http://upload-magazin.de/?p=1220">unclear legal status in Germany</a> [de]. The fact of the matter is, since somebody can put an arbitrary email address into the email field when commenting, a person who didn't want that may get "spammed" by my blog against their will.

That would result in a situation where the seeming "victim" of my "spam" could sue me for unsolicited advertisement, provided my blog is considered <em>commercial</em>--and depending on the judge, even a link to Amazon can make a website "commercial".

It is sad that German laws are so Internet-unfriendly, but I have to live with them. So I <strong>switched off email notifications</strong> on my blog until further notice.

I may switch to a double-opt-in solution (i.e., before notifications are sent, people have to click a link in an email to confirm they actually requested this service). While this is also not completely <em>safe</em> in legal terms (that means, no significant court has ruled about it yet), it is currently considered <em>state of the art</em> when it comes to sending out any sort of regular email to a group of people.

Since a lot of people are facing this problem, maybe the plugin's author or somebody else will extend the plugin to have double-opt-in functionality soon. I may even do it myself when I am bored the next time.

Until then, sorry for the inconvenience. You can always subscribe to the <a href="http://fredericiana.com/comments/feed/">Comments RSS feed</a> if you want to stay up to date with what's happening here.
