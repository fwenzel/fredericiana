<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/6508701653/" title="Day 347 - Deskorama by Fredâ€‹, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7012/6508701653_f70ff1d95c.jpg" width="500" height="68" alt="Day 347 - Deskorama"/></a>

Today I took a panorama picture of the space around my desk at the office (courtesy of <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.debaclesoftware.pano">Pano</a>). The quality of the stitching is a little worse than what I am used to from using <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a> (a full-blown panorama software), but you can't beat the instantly-on-your-phone experience.

Of course, in order to really see the photo, you might have to check it out in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/6508701653/sizes/o/">original size</a>. Also featured in the shot: Mike Kelly, busy making awesome web apps.
