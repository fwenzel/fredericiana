Dear GMail,

I would like you to know that it really really sucks how you add everybody to my address book who I only sent one mail to, ever. That clogs the address book and depending on what kind of message it was, after just about 30 seconds I neither care nor remember what I wrote them an email about once in my lifetime.

Imagine me writing an email to some company's customer service. I get an answer from a representative asking me to provide some more information. I reply and attach the needed infos. You helpfully add this person to my address book so I can remember every customer service representative that I ever had to deal with, just in case I ever need to email them personally again. Thank you so much!

Let alone all these <strong>random people</strong> on craigslist who use a gmail address who you <strong>add to my instant messenger automatically</strong>, so they can start chatting with me or at the very least see me being online for the next 25 years.

A <strong>one-click option</strong> to add somebody to your address book is a <strong>great idea</strong>. Automatically adding everybody to my <strong>address bucket</strong> (that mess is not a book anymore) however is a <strong>bad idea</strong>.

Just sayin'...
