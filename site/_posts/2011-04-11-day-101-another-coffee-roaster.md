After I've shown you a small, old (and presumably out of order) coffee roaster <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/03/08/day-67-coffee-roaster/">on day 67</a>, here's another small roaster, but this time a modern one in best working order.

I saw it running at Whole Foods in Los Altos, CA, and thought it was kind of cool how you could see the beans on the inside.

If you care, here's a video of the thing running:
