What, you don't know what German curtains are? Glad you asked! These white lacy curtains are in place in <abbr title="Gross generalization. You're welcome.">eeevery</abbr> German home's windows -- presumably not to block out any light, as they completely fail at that, but to keep curious looks at bay. Actual sunlight is then blocked by either a second set of long, darker curtains (rarely) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_shutter">roller shutters</a> (more frequently). Too bad you can't see these curtains on Google Street View, given the buildings have most likely been blurred out as the same people who dislike real-life looks are also not too fond of digital ones...
