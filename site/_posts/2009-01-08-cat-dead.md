This week, I went to the exhibition "life on mars" in the <a href="http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/">Carnegie International Gallery</a>. All in all a fun collection, and one of the most curious exhibits was this:

<img src="/media/wp/2009/01/cat-im-dead.jpg" alt="Cat: I&#039;m dead" title="Cat: I&#039;m dead" width="375" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1910" />

<a href="http://blog.cmoa.org/CI08/2008/05/im-dead.php">David Shrigley, 2007: "I'm dead".</a> The gallery guide writes about this:

<blockquote>With a deliberately naïve style and an intellectually dark sense of humor verging on the absurd, David Shrigley makes drawings, paintings, sculptures, and photographs that collectively illustrate a scathing commentary on the various artistic, social, and political states of humanity. Almost without exception, his works are hilarious, cynical, and sharply intelligent, covering topics that range from music, art, politics, and health care to religion, sexuality, and life and death. Beneath the flamboyant irony and self-deprecating humor lies an undercurrent of vulnerability that lends many of Shrigley's illustrations and objects a bracing poignancy and reveals intimate notions of individual and collective identities. (...) In <em>I'm Dead</em> (2007) a taxidermied kitten stands sentry with a wooden sign indicating his deceased status—an absurdly ironic yet tender work bordering on the grotesque.</blockquote>

I can tell you, I laughed out loud. Quite literally, even, not in the <em>laughing-quietly-on-the-inside-LOL-instant-message</em> sense. Who would've thought museum visits can be so much fun?
