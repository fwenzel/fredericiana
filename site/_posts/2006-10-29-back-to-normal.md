Gosh, all these visitors were giving my server a hard time.

No wonder, after my <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2006/10/24/from-redmond-with-love/">cake story</a> got <a href="http://digg.com/software/Microsoft_sends_congratulation_cake_to_Mozilla">dugg more than 3500 times</a>, <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/26/1238239">slashdotted</a>, <a href="http://www.valleywag.com/tech/ie/ie-to-mozilla-let-them-eat-cake-209914.php">"valleywagged"</a> and I don't know what else...

You guys were very supportive when it came to helping me picking up the tab, <strong>thanks!</strong> I got a lot of help from <a href="http://fredericiana.com/mozilla-cake-bandwidth-donations/">supporters</a> who all gave me a dollar-or-so, so I decided to send a small check to the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a> and another one to the <a href="http://osuosl.org/">OSU Open Source Lab</a>.

The OSU OSL is where some of Mozilla's servers are and they work hard for some of the <a href="http://osuosl.org/hosting/clients">finest projects</a> in the Open Source world, and they also need our support. Through the collaboration of the OSL and Mozilla, that <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2006/10/firefox_2_milli.html">a whole lot of Firefox downloads</a> can take place flawlessly at the same time, free of charge.

You are great. Thanks again!

(And I hope some people keep my blog in their feed reader :))
