Another delicious creation from Tara's cuisine: Purée of Carrot Soup, after a recipe published in the 1960s by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._F._K._Fisher">M.F.K. Fisher</a>. Yummy!

The recipe still called for a food mill, but, in the 21st century an immersion blender works just as well :)
