After spending some time celebrating and getting to know each other better, it's time to make the Mozilla Work Week deserve its name, and look ahead! A meeting to attract as many people as you see in the picture can only mean one thing: Firefox. The <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~sayrer/2011/temp/process.html">new development process</a> is well underway, with a huge impact not only on Firefox itself, but on all supporting properties, like Mozilla's various websites and webtools. All of this will lead to getting new features (and of course, bug fixes) into the users' hands faster than ever before, and I am excited to help make this happen!
