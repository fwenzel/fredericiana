Are you looking to hire a sysadmin?

An American friend of mine has just moved back to the U.S. after working in Germany for a while. He is currently <strong>looking for a job</strong> as a <strong>Sys/Network Admin</strong> or similar in Northern California (Sacramento or Bay Area).

If you are <strong>looking to hire somebody</strong> or <strong>know somebody who does</strong>, please <a href="http://justindow.com/Files/Resume-en.pdf">check out his resume online</a> and drop him a line, or leave a comment here and I'll connect.

Thanks for your help!
