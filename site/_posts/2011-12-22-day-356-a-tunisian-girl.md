This year, Time magazine named <a href="http://rt.com/news/time-protester-person-year-799/">"The Protester"</a> its "Person of the Year". Inside, they cover several key people in the 2011 protests around the world, among them linguistics teacher and blogger Lina Ben Mhenni (<a href="http://atunisiangirl.blogspot.com/">"A Tunisian Girl"</a>). In the picture, she's carrying her "sword" -- the laptop she uses to write her influential blog. To my delight, she decorated it with a Firefox sticker, along with various others about privacy and political activism.

Hat-tip to Lina: Thank you for standing up for civil rights in your country and everywhere in the world.
