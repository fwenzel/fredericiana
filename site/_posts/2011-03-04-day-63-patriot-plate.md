There's one kind of letter the financially handicapped State of California will always find enough postage to send: The yearly registration renewal notices from the DMV. And not only do they cordially invite me to pay my fees on time (conveniently mentioning just how expensive it gets if I don't). Being the good salesmen they are, they let me order personalizes license plates along with it! For only a handful of dollars, you too can be a patriot today!
