Yesterday, Apple <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/18/apple-finally-fixes-some-macbook-keyboard-issues/">released a system update</a> that is supposed to fix the <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2007/11/27/osx-leopard-keyboard-problems/">severe "keyboard unresponsive" bug</a> in OS&nbsp;X Leopard:

<a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/fredw/1122788"><img src='/media/wp/2007/12/apple-keyboard-update.jpg' alt='Update for the Apple Keyboard Bug(s)' /></a>

With hardly 800K in size, the patch is a lightweight that could have a big influence. If that's not the right place to use the <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5imcJd2ELqieBlFxBLhBnP5k4juaAD8TFGLM00">word of the year</a>, where else: <strong>W00t</strong>.

I just installed it and so far, the keyboard works fine, but of course I haven't sent the box to sleep yet, so by now I can't tell yet if the patch actually fixed the bug. Of course, the reboot the update asked for promptly resulted in a <a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/fredw/1122799">kernel panic</a> (great start), but luckily, another reboot went through without problems.

If you like, please <strong>let me know</strong> in the comments if the patch worked for you or not. Good luck!
