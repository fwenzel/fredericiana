Today's Picture of the Day is a series of photos, as I made an Italian delicacy: <strong>Limoncello</strong>, a liqueur made from lemon zest.

The base ingredient: Untreated lemons from the farmers' market.

Next step: Recipe, jar, Everclear (75%. The concentration should be higher, but sadly, that's not sold in California).

Step 3: Zesting. We want all the yellow and none of the bitter white stuff.

Almost done: Half a liter of booze and all the zest into the jar.

Done (for now):

This concoction will now sit in the dark for a few weeks, before I take it out and carry on. By then, the alcohol will have drawn all the good stuff out of the zest and into the liquid.

Oh and by the way, the "naked" lemons were turned into delicious, delicious lemonade. Looks like we got the most bang for our buck.

Stay tuned for the next chapter :)
