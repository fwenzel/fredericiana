I recently saw this on the local network at the unversity:

<img src="/media/wp/2008/07/hacked-iphone-bonjour.jpg" alt="" title="Bonjour, Hacked iPhone" width="396" height="368" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1332" />

Well, at least the user was honest :) If he was aware that his iPhone would tell everybody of its existence through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)">Bonjour</a>? That, I don't know.
