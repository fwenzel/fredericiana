A seemingly abandoned stroller-gone-shopping-cart in Mountain View. Funnily, I've seen plenty of both: groceries shoe-horned into strollers, and children wheeled around more or less awkwardly in shopping carts. Sounds like there's a market for trading these things (transportation devices, that is, not children). Start-up idea, anyone?
