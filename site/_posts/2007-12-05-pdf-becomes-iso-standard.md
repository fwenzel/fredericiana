As <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/insidepdf/2007/12/iso_ballot_for_pdf_17_passed.html">Adobe's James King has blogged yesterday</a>, the <strong>PDF format</strong> (in its version 1.7) has just become an <strong>ISO standard</strong> (number 32000). The final standardization document is expected to be published in early 2008.

Almost a year after the work on the standardization has <a href="http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS7542722606.html">started</a>, the ballot was passed yesterday with 13 vs. 1 votes. The only country to oppose the motion was France, and Russia abstained.

PDF as an open standard: For the file format landscape, I believe this is a good move. As members of international teams have already known for a long time (at least since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a>), you can only really work together if you speak a common language. Standardized, open file formats are the common language of the internet age. Now, PDF is in good company, along with the Open Document File format that has <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8184331228.html">already been standardized in 2006</a>.
