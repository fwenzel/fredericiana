<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/5470547202/" title="Day 53 - Self Portrait by Fredâ€‹, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5015/5470547202_7e8564e945.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Day 53 - Self Portrait" /></a>

Today I took a self portrait at the office. Just so my dear readers know what I look like when I do Project 365. The attentive ones among you might recognize the sketch in the background from <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/02/04/day-35-crop-circle/">day 35</a>.

The "mirror", by the way, is a regular window, whose sun protection coating becomes really reflective when it's <del datetime="2011-02-23T21:54:06+00:00">light</del> <ins datetime="2011-02-23T21:54:06+00:00">dark</ins> outside.
