The new feature called "content-aware image resizing" in Photoshop is amazing. There is a <a href="http://av.adobe.com/russellbrown/ContentAwareScale_SM.mov">promotional video up on the Adobe site</a> that's really fun to watch. For example, they make a Volkswagen bus more "economical" (mind you, while keeping the wheels round):

<a href="http://av.adobe.com/russellbrown/ContentAwareScale_SM.mov"><img src="/media/wp/2008/10/content-aware-image-resizing.jpg" alt="" title="Content-aware Image Resizing" width="500" height="392" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1683" /></a>

The technology behind it is based on research from an Isreali research group. That group put a video up on youtube in 2007 already:

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qadw0BRKeMk&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qadw0BRKeMk&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

It's a little more technical, but no less impressive, so all of you geeks who wonder how it actually works should watch this as well.

I can tell you one thing: I want this in Firefox's page resizing code. Sadly, I assume it is strictly patented and Adobe will probably have made sure to have some sort of exclusive deal on it.

<strong>Update:</strong> A commenter points out, there is an <a href="http://liquidrescale.wikidot.com/">open source plugin for the GIMP that does content-aware resizing</a>--already since 2007. <em>Thank you, Gandalf!</em>
