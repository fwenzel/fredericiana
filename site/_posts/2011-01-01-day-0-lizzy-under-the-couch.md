<em>Under the couch</em> is decidedly Lizzy's favorite spot in our entire house. Of course, she has trouble both getting into and out of it, but that doesn't deter her the slightest bit from getting under there whenever she can.

Taken with a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. Cropped and lighted up the shadows a tad.
