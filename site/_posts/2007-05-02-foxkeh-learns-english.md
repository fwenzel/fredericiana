<a href='http://www.foxkeh.com/' title='Foxkeh, the Mozilla Japan Mascot' class="alignright" ><img src='/media/wp/2007/05/foxkeh.jpg' alt='Foxkeh, the Mozilla Japan Mascot' style="padding-left:1em" /></a>Mozilla Japan's Mascot, a little "firefox" named <strong>Foxkeh</strong>, became popular across the Japanese speaking Internet quite quickly and wherever he goes, people seem to like the cute little fellow.

I personally always liked his <a href="http://foxkeh.jp/downloads/wallpapers/">monthly wallpapers</a> (featuring foxkeh and the current calendar), though admittedly I wasn't quite able to read <a href="http://foxkeh.jp/">Foxkeh's Japanese blog</a>.

As of today though, <a href="http://www.foxkeh.com/">Foxkeh has an English blog</a> as well, foxkeh.com, and you should check it out.

After all, you are as curious to learn new things about the web and Firefox as Foxkeh is, aren't you?
