Oh thank heaven for the beauty of context-sensitive advertising.

As most people on the Mozilla project, I get quite a bit of bugmail from bugzilla. Needless to say, Google mail tries to adapt to this situation by delivering me the ads that they believe are the most appropriate for the mail I am currently looking at:

<img src="/media/wp/2008/04/bug-reincarnated.jpg" alt="" title="Reincarnated as a bug?" width="499" height="41" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1266" />

"Will you be <strong>reincarnated as a bug</strong>?"

Well, I hope not! What if they resolve me INVALID?
