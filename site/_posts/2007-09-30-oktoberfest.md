When I went to Oktoberfest last week, I did not take my camera with me to the "Wies'n" (which is Bavarian for "meadow", btw.) because I feared it may get stolen in the crowd.

Turns out, other people are doing the work for me: Here's a video of a quick <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/008857.html">walk through the <strong>Augustiner brewery</strong> tent</a> which happens to be the one me and my friends found a spot in. Enjoy.
