Hey, you know I <a href="http://fredericiana.de/archives/2005/09/07/welcome-to-portland/">arrived well in Portland, Oregon</a>, don't you? If not: <strong>I did</strong> ;)

By the way, when we were asking our personal student advisor about good places to eat something here in Portland, he mentioned: 

<blockquote>"McDonald's is crap. <strong>Avoid it at all times.</strong> In fact, nobody wants to go to McDonald's."</blockquote>

So you know what I promise to you, precious readers?

<strong>I hereby promise that I avoid McDonalds as long as possible.</strong>

And this is a <strong>really</strong> hard task when being in the U.S., you can probably imagine? - And I promise, too, that I immediately admit it publicly (i.e., here ;) ) when I went to McD for the first time during my stay here.

I mean, my fellows really must <em>force</em> me then to go to McD. Voluntarily, wild horses don't drag me there. Seriously! :)
