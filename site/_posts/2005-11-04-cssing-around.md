Today I went to a tiny little <a href="http://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> workshop at OSU. One of the other <a href="http://osuosl.org/about/staff/document_view">OSL guys</a><sup><a href="#fn27-1">1</a></sup> was talking about building accessible web sites with CSS.

Pretty interesting stuff. And, even though I should already know all that, I am always glad to hear stuff from different perspectives.

<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/di1980/43594468/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/43594468_47e636533c_m_d.jpg" alt="Pencils, CC licensed from flickr" class="alignleft" /></a>However, it make me wanna play on some CSS again. I wanted to rebuild the <a href="http://www.eg-abi2002.de/">website of my high school graduation class</a> since some months anyway. After a weird incident<sup><a href="#fn27-2">2</a></sup>, I had to take the news script off the site, making it more or less <em>static</em> and not truly informative anymore.

At the same time, I wanted to try out <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> as a somehow lightweight, but also mighty content management system. A friend of mine really prefers it for <a href="http://paland.net/portfolio">her websites</a> (therefore recommended it to me more than once), and she recently did some <a href="http://paland.net/blog">very nice CSS magic on her blog</a>.

For today, I only made my laptop carry a lighttpd webserver and snagged some old website source code. But I am going to hack on textpattern soon<sup><a href="#fn27-3">3</a></sup>.

Thanks for bringing <em>"CSS mojo"</em> to my mind again, <a href="http://morgamic.com">Morgamic</a>!

Ah, if you want to read more about it, Mike made a nice <a href="http://wiki.osuosl.org/display/howto/Creating+an+Accessible+Template+with+CSS">"Accessible CSS" wiki page</a> with quite a bunch of useful links for you.

Oh, and thanks for reading the article with the most footnotes I ever made ;)<sup><a href="#fn27-4">4</a></sup>

<a name="fn27-1">[1]</a> by the way, I should bug someone to include me in this list - have to take a photo, though :)
<a name="fn27-2">[2]</a> some script kiddie defaced the site through a security flaw in the news script we were using.
<a name="fn27-3">[3]</a> maybe on the <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/news/?p=25">OSLUG hacking social</a>? If I go there once after band rehearsal on wednesdays... ;)
<a name="fn27-4">[4]</a> I'm serious!
