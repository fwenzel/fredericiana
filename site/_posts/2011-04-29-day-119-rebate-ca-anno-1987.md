Unlike <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2011/01/19/day-19-rebate-card/">100 days ago</a>, today's mail-in rebate (of a whopping 5 dollars) came with as this ancient technology known as a "check". On the upside, my bank let me use one of these elaborate workarounds for incredibly outdated systems: Scanning and uploading the check to the website.

If it worked out, rebate plus gas savings should add up to almost two coffees! Woah!
