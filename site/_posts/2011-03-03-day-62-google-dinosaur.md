Mozilla isn't the only <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/morgamic/4564676077/">company with dinosaurs</a>. This is the gigantic <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/06/19/10-google-facts/">T-Rex skeleton</a> on Google's main campus in Mountain View, CA.

It's pretty awesome.

(For a while now it's had some plastic flamingos stuck in it, but hey, who's going to be critical.)
