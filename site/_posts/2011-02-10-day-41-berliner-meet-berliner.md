Today, a nice colleague brought plenty of Krispy Kreme donuts to the office, to all our enjoyment. The one I had was a jelly-filled donut. Such a donut is called <em>"Berliner"</em> in southwest Germany, where I come from.

Which reminded me of John F. Kennedy's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner">famous speech</a> in Berlin in 1963, where he declared: <em>All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words 'Ich bin ein Berliner!'</em>.

So, did Kennedy tell the citizens of Berlin: <em>"I am a jelly donut"</em>? Not quite. In that region of Germany, this pastry is simply known as <em>"Pfannkuchen"</em> -- pancakes. So while certain onlookers on television might have found it funny, this humorous interpretation of the sentence went unnoticed by his local audience.
