That's right, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/163856011/ref=topnav_storetab_dm_hp_nav_lk/105-1201370-7946809">Amazon's new DRM-free MP3 store</a> is an awesome alternative to the iTunes Music Store. All files are 256kbit and usually cost 89-99 cents each. This is the same quality as Apple's "iTunes Plus" but at least 30 cents cheaper.

Now we only need this in Europe too (where we are currently paying 99 Euro cents for DRMed and 1.29 for not DRMed songs which, at the current weak dollar rate, is an ugly 1.40 USD and 1.82 USD, respectively).

And I am curious to see how Apple will react to this. <strong>Bring it on, Steve!</strong>
