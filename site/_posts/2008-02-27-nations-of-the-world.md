A little video from the Animaniacs TV show featuring a song about the nations of the world.

Funny how they sing <strong>"Germany now in one piece"</strong> -- of course some things are outdated too, such as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>". Needless to say that "Yugoslavia" is also a thing of the past. These facts, by the way, date the song <strong>somewhere between 1990 and 1993</strong>, if I am not mistaken.
