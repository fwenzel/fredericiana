Here at Mozilla, we take pride in our community -- it is the number one reason that Firefox is awesome. One great community project in the past was the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=347226">Firefox Crop Circle</a>. This is a (the?) blueprint that was used to make the project happen, and we show it off on one of our office walls, not far from my desk, where I see it every day.
