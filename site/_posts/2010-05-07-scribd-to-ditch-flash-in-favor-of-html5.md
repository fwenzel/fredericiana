After <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/29/steve-jobs-apple-adobe-flash/">Apple</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/30/microsoft-html5/">Microsoft</a> have (finally!) publicly announced they are ready to pull the plug on Adobe Flash, the first makers of Flash webapps are starting to ditch it in favor of HTML5: As <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/05/scribd-html5/">Techcrunch writes</a>, Scribd, an online document hosting service, will focus its efforts on HTML5 from now on.

<blockquote>Scribd co-founder and chief technology officer Jared Friedman tells [Techcrunch]: “We are scrapping three years of Flash development and betting the company on HTML5 because we believe HTML5 is a dramatically better reading experience than Flash. Now any document can become a Web page.”</blockquote>

I am very pleased to hear that. Now that web standards are finally offering the kind of versatility modern web applications need, it is a fantastic development that companies are getting rid of the monster that is Flash. That's good for the user for so many reasons, and it's a great example of what HTML5 can really do.

<strong>Update:</strong> Ryan points out in the comments that Scribd has a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/documents/30964170/Scribd-in-HTML5">demo document</a> online of what this is going to look like. It's fantastic!

By the way: Another company I would like to see getting rid of Flash (in fact, I never understood why they used it in the first place) is <a href="http://slideshare.net">slideshare</a>. They are turning into a de-facto standard for posting presentation slides online, but as of yet, their main UI is solidly in Flash's claws. :(
