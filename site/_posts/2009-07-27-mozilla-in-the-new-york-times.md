As indicated by the title -- "For Mozilla and Google, Group Hugs are Getting Tricky", the author puts some emphasis onto the Google/Mozilla relationship, which among the community tends to be a big point of interest. Quote:

<blockquote>"In many ways, Google and Mozilla are fighting the same battle, albeit not with the same objectives. They both contend that the Web should be open and based on common standards â€” Mozilla because it is its mission, Google because it is good for its business."</blockquote>

Highly recommended reading, even for non-geeks, who are interested in Mozilla and the Web as a whole.
