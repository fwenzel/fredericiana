I just read that Penguin Books offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' famous "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>" for free <a href="http://thepenguinpodcast.blogs.com/podcast/2005/12/a_christmas_car.html">download on its website as an audiobook podcast</a>.

Go ahead, download it and finally get in a christmas mood :) And be fast - it will only be there till the end of december.

P.S.: By the way: The podcast is read with a wonderful british accent :) It's not what you hear very often around here!
