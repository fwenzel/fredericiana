Say hi to Atlanta's Finest: These motorcycle cops were getting ready to keep the surroundings of tonight's <em>Kentucky -- Alabama</em> game safe. (It took me a little bit of research to find out what game exactly this was, even though the Kentucky part wasn't hard to guess given the abundance of people in blue <em>UK</em> gear all over downtown Atlanta).

These cops later dispersed as quickly as they had assembled, leaving behind only a single, fellow policeman on a different set of two-wheeler: A Segway.
