I am delighted to report that in the <a href="http://github.com/fwenzel/reporter">project I am currently working on</a>, I get to play with a lot of smiley faces:

<img src="/media/wp/2010/05/smiley-feedback.jpg" alt="" title="Feedback Smiley" width="528" height="387" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2727" />

Hope that lightens up your day a little :)

(Yes, you guessed right: For every smiley page there is an equivalent with a frowny face, but sheesh, don't tell anyone ;))
