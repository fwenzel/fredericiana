ABC news has a list of <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/PCWorld/story?id=3312143">100 blogs they "love"</a>.

<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/">Asa's "Firefox and more"</a> is one of them. Congrats, Asa!

Sadly, the ABC people <strong>don't link</strong> to a single blog on their list, as <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/06/13936.html">kottke already mentioned</a>. (Incidentally, he's on the list himself.)

So yeah, maybe somebody should give them a hyperlinks 101. But apart from that, the list is pretty well done --with no apparent surprises-- but a good one to look at if you want to know who the cool guys are.
