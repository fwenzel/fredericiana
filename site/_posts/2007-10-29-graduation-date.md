Inspired by a <a href="http://blog.fligtar.com/2007/09/18/graduation-date/">post Justin Scott made a while ago</a>, let's summarize how much more it'll take me to <strong>graduate from college</strong>: To my surprise, I realized a few months ago that I am actually pretty close -- I only have a handful more classes left, but see for yourself:
<ul>
	<li>Operating Systems Design <em>(4h)</em></li>
	<li>Multicore and Cluster Computing <em>(2h)</em></li>
	<li>Data Warehousing and Data Mining <em>(3h)</em></li>
	<li>Human-Computer Interaction <em>(3h)</em></li>
	<li>Organizational Theory <em>(3h)</em></li>
	<li>Seminar: Economic Anomalies and Paradoxes</li>
</ul>

(The hours mean hours per week, all through the semester, and do not include recitations or tutorials).

After that, I will have to write a 6-months masters thesis, and after that, I will graduate with a masters degree in Information Engineering and Management.

All this adds up to about a year which -- if you ask me -- is pretty awesome.
