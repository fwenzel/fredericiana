title: Hand-Crafted Blog Spam

It seems to me like some people have a little too much time at their hands: I recently notice a bunch of hand-crafted spam coming in to my blog, mainly as comments to the famous (<em>infamous?</em>) <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2006/10/24/from-redmond-with-love/">cake article</a>.

The comments look something like this:
<div class="img-label">
<img src='/media/wp/2007/12/handcraftedspam.jpg' alt='Hand Crafted Wordpress Spam' />
Some hand-crafted wordpress spam, notice how the comment makes sense but the supplied URL is quite apparently promoting spam content.
</div>

Interestingly, most of these comments actually link to pages that promote some sort of shady <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Scheme">pyramid scheme</a>. Looks like these people desperately surf the web searching for well-visited blog posts and drop spam in there -- by hand.

Yet, even if they manage to get through comment moderation, they are not likely to squeeze any "search engine juice" out of it, since Wordpress marks commenters' homepage links as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow">nofollow</a> by default.

And though I would like to tell them they can save their keystrokes and that they are wasting their time (and, more importantly, mine too), I can probably drop that, since chances are, none of these people will ever actually <em>read</em> the blogs they are spamming...
