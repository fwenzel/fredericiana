When coming home from vacation, this tin sign had jumped off <del>a cliff</del><ins>the wall</ins> and bent a corner in the process. Apparently, those poster sticky thingies are not made for tin signs, even the paper thin variant? Seems like I need to engineer a slightly cleverer way of hanging this up.
