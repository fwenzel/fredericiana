A teen from New Jersey <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6963696.stm">unlocked the iPhone</a>, so it can be used with non-US phone networks. Nice move.

The hack takes <em>"about two hours and involves some soldering and skill with software"</em> though, the guy says. So, if you don't want to brick your phone, maybe it's not such a good idea after all.

Also, I wonder how long it takes until the companies in question sue the bejesus out of that kid. Or, if they are smart, they just hire him. We'll see.
