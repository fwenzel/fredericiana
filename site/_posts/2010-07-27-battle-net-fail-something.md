As it turns out, Blizzard Entertainment's game service <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle.net">battle.net</a> has a fail pet!

Well, "fail pet" might be the wrong word for this, but who expected battle.net to have a cutesy kitten on their error pages anyway. Instead, they have a fellow who somewhat looks like the alien cousin of Lennie from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Mice_and_Men">"Of Mice and Men"</a>.

"Oops", indeed!
