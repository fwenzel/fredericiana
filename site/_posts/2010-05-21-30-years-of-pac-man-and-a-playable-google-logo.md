It's the 30th anniversary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man">arcade classic Pac-Man</a>, one of my all-time favorite computer games. 

Apparently, Google agrees, so they celebrate it with a <strong>playable</strong> (that's right) Google logo: Today, Google is most certainly distracting more people from work than Facebook.

This is awesome. Make sure to try it out before the end of the day!

(If you missed it, I am confident it'll show up in the Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/logos/index.html">doodle gallery</a> soon.)

<strong>Update:</strong> Tobias and JP point out the <a href="http://www.google.com/pacman/">Google's Pacman logo</a> now has a permanent residence on the web. Great!
