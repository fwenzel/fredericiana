The flag of Santa Clara County at Mountain View City Hall was flown at half-staff today. Why, the Interwebs wouldn't tell me. Anyone know? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Pearl_Harbor_Remembrance_Day">Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day</a> is too far back, and besides it'd be the wrong one of the flags. Hmmm!
