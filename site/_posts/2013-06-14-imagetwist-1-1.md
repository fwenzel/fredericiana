title: imagetwist 1.1 now twists even harder
---
I just released a new version of [imagetwist][blogpost]!

Everyone's favorite image rotation add-on can now apply EXIF-based "auto-rotation" to any image on a page. Also, if you want to go back to the original image, I added an option to restore it (previously, you would have to reload the page).

Here's what the new right-click menu looks like:

If you're curious, there are [a few more features][issues] waiting to be implemented, such as mirroring of images (for front-facing cell phone cameras) and a nice rotation transition. But those will have to wait for a future release.

Download the [latest version of imagetwist][amo] from the Mozilla Add-ons website!
