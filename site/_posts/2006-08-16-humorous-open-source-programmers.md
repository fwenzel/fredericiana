This leads to things like the "insult" setting for <tt>sudo</tt>, which makes fun of you everytime you mistype the password. It's interesting to get messages like 

<blockquote>"Maybe you should use more than two fingers, next time!</blockquote>

when you happen to hit the Enter key too fast.

Or, today I realized that another command works quite flawlessly:

<code>who mom loves</code>

gives you information about... <strong>you</strong>. Who else would mom love? Interestingly the Mac OSX programmers don't quite seem to have <em>that</em> kind of humor, so they just allow <tt>who am i</tt>, which also works on Linux.

Any other funny commands you guys know about?
