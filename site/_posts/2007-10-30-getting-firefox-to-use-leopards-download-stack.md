<blockquote>Find your downloads quickly in one dedicated stack. Downloads from Safari, iChat, and Mail are automatically saved to the <strong>Downloads stack</strong>. Say goodbye to desktop clutter.</blockquote>

... says <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#desktop">Apple's "new feature" description</a> for Mac OS X Leopard. What it doesn't mention is that you can make (almost) any software you like use the "Download Stack".

Fact is, the "Download Stack" just displays the contents of a folder named "Download" in your home directory (which Leopard automatically creates). So, making Firefox use it is fairly simple -- here is how:

Go to the preferences window, into the "Main" tab:
<img src='/media/wp/2007/10/firefox-downloads-settings.jpg' alt='Download Preferences for Firefox' />

Under "save files to", go to your user folder, then choose the folder named "Downloads".

Save the settings -- and next time you download something off the net, you'll see that it is easily (and instantly) accessible through the neat little "Download Stack" in your dock (in this case my local bus schedule. <em>What a meaningful file name.</em>).

<em>"Goodbye, desktop clutter"</em>, indeed!
