So yeah, another day, another blog meme, and this one seriously is on the cheesy side but fair enough: <strong>I am C++</strong>. ;)

<a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2006/08/language_quiz.php"><img src="http://www.bbspot.com/Images/News_Features/2006/08/language/cplusplus.jpg" width="300" height="90" border="0" alt="You are C++. You are very popular and open to suggestions.  Many have tried to be like you, but haven't been successful"/><br />Which Programming Language are You?</a>

I am not sure if that's a good or a bad thing -- especially considering I haven't coded in C++ in, well, forever. The closest I've got in the last years was Java cause most programming assignments in my university are in Java. And whenever I can choose freely, let's just put it like that: C++ is usually not on top of my list.

Now, which one are you?
