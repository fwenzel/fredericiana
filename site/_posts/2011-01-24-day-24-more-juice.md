Two weeks ago, my two-year-old laptop battery decided to kick the bucket and give me a whopping 40 minutes of maximum runtime before suddenly switching off. No bueno! Today, the replacement arrived.

On the upside, though, this really helps keeping meetings short and sweet when you're about to run out of battery any minute. You should try it sometime!
