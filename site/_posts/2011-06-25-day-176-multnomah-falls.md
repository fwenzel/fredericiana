Today we took a fantastic little trip down (or up, I guess) the Columbia River Gorge, with stops at Multnomah Falls, Hood River's very own Full Sail Brewery, and the Bonneville Dam.

This is an HDR shot of the falls, which are surrounded by lots and lots of very nice forest: The Oregonian rain clearly is good for something!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/sets/72157626924154619/">My photos of the entire extravaganza</a> are online, because after venturing into the outside world, geeks always find back into the comforting, electron-infused arms of the good old Interwebs.
