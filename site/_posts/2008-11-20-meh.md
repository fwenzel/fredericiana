<img src="/media/wp/2008/11/meh-fortune-cookie.jpg" alt="" title="&quot;Meh&quot; fortune cookie" width="240" height="180" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1832" align="right" />The ultimate expression of indifference, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3467717/Word-featured-in-The-Simpsons-becomes-latest-addition-to-Collins-English-Dictionary.html">"Meh.", made it into the dictionary</a>:

<blockquote><em>Meh</em>, which can mean unimpressed, mediocre or boring, was chosen as the public's entry for the 30th anniversary edition of Collins English Dictionary which will be published next year.</blockquote>

While the term is probably not <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/08/23/flickr-embiggens-pictures/">another term originating in "the Simpsons"</a>, it was prominently featured in an episode:

<blockquote>Cormac McKeown, head of content at Collins Dictionaries, said: "This is a new interjection from the US that seems to have inveigled its way into common speech over here.

"It was actually spelled out in The Simpsons when Homer is trying to prise the kids away from the TV with a suggestion for a day trip.

"They both just reply 'meh' and keep watching TV; he asks again and Lisa says 'We said MEH! - M-E-H, meh!'</blockquote>

Does that make "meh" a perfectly <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cromulent">cromulent</a> word? I think so.
