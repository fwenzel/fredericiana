It's time for another food photo in the <a href="http://fredericiana.com/category/english/photo/project-365/">project 365</a> collection. This is salad with warm goat cheese, and it was all sorts of delicious.

I like wide-angle photographs like this for inside photography, as it is so hard to get a lot into the frame otherwise. Keeping straight lines from looking completely ridiculously curvy can be a challenge, but what would a photo project be without those ;)
