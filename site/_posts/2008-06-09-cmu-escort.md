I begin to like this: Today I used the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/police/escort.htm">CMU Escort</a> to get home from school. It's basically a <strong>night shuttle bus</strong> that takes you from campus (there are bus stops) to any street corner within a 1.5 mile radius from campus. That can be veeery convenient (need I mention it is free for ID card holders).

No, dear night owls, they won't pick you up at your favorite bar when you're too drunk to find your way home on your own -- but if you happen to remember where campus is, they would probably pick you up there.

All in all, this makes it easy and safe to get home even when the regular buses are done for the night, which happens more or less early, depending on the bus line.
