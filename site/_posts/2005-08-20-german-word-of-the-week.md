Though IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m quite experienced in <i>reading</i> English, I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t <i>write</i> much in it, recently (okaaay, except from three-word sentences on application forms). Soon, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to write <i>much</i> English stuff at university, though. So letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s start <b>practising</b> by blogging on the English blog more often. ;) (Maybe it also pushes visitor statistics on fredericiana.comÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Currently itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very seldomly visited by anyone. No wonder for it has only a handful of articles right now)<br />
<br />
So, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a <b>blog</b> I want to recommend: ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s called <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/">German Joys</a> (written by a law professor from Duesseldorf, Germany) and has a nice category very worth reading: <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/german_word_of_the_week/index.html">"German Word of the Week"</a>. Once a week, he very interestingly describes strange German words. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite funny so reading it is not even boring for native speakers like me.<br />
<br />
Just take a look a this weekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s word: <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2005/08/german_word_of_.html">Stoibern</a>. (Behaving like the State Minister of Bavaria, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Stoiber">Edmund Stoiber</a> :) )<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
