Even in the evening sun, it is still a tiny little bit too cold to sit on these benches quite yet.

Following morgamic's advice, I stopped down three stops from my lens' maximum aperture, making the image ridiculously sharp (zoom in to check it out). I am quite pleased with the result. Only needed to straighten it a little -- apparently, when mechanical body enhancements have gone mainstream (must be any day now), I'm going to have to have a level built into my elbow.
