As we all know, September-born children are the best anyway (well, at least I did).

Sadly, they also seem to be among the most <strong>badly sighted</strong> ones:

Israeli researchers now found out that <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1188128148948&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">being born during the summer increases the risk of becoming near-sighted</a> significantly:

<blockquote>Children born in June and July - the months with the most sunshine - are 25 percent more likely to become nearsighted (myopic) than those born in December or January, according to Israeli research just published in the on-line edition of the most prestigious eye medicine journal, Ophthalmology. <em>(...)</em>
The more light a newborn is exposed to after birth, the more the eyeball lengthens, according to the study, causing images to be focused in the vitreous part inside the eye rather than on the retina at the back of the eye.</blockquote>

Well, at least now I have a clue where my glasses come from -- and I guess I am lucky not to be born during the <em>really</em> bright months, or I'd be a <em>total</em> mole.
