<blockquote>The Mac user's last words: <strong>"More RAM!"</strong> ;)</blockquote>

<img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/85759173_ff9adfff60_m.jpg" alt="Mac Mini; CC-licensed; Source: http://flickr.com/photos/darice/85759173/" class="alignright" />After using the Mac Mini for quite a while, I <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2005/12/22/linux-vs-os-x-on-mac-mini/">switched</a> my primary Operating System to Linux/PPC (more exactly, Ubuntu Linux, but this might change over time).

Meanwhile, I found out that Java is a pain on Linux, especially on the PowerPC architecture. The Sun Java packages are not available, so the only ones you can use are the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/java/">GNU Java Compiler</a> or a <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/download.html">commercial Java variant from IBM</a>. As the GNU version is very unfortunately quite slow (and some applications do not even run on it, for numerous reasons), I managed to install the latter. For that, I followed a <a href="http://www.ubuntu.org.cn/support/documentation/wiki/JavaPPC">Java PPC Howto in a Ubuntu forum</a>. Quite frankly, the fact that the howto is in Chinese didn't make the process any easier, but I managed to read the important information out of the few code snippets on that site.

Now, the Java programs I want to run work quite flawlessly most of the time. Unfortunately, one of the components seems to have a memory leak. And I am not quite sure if it's the Java JRE or the (always very memory-greedy) Java-coded software I am using. Recently, it even filled up my whole system memory, including Swap, preventing me from accessing the system for almost five minutes, until the Java program crashed and I was able to work again. The system load had reached the truly magical number of <strong>49</strong> at this point. At least, the whole system did not crash: Respect to the stability of the PowerPC Port of the Linux OS.

In any case, even though I really like Linux on my Mac, I wanted to use OS&nbsp;X at some time again. But since "it is just no fun to run OS&nbsp;X with less than 1 Gig of RAM" <em>(<a href="http://blog.jeanpierre.de/2006/01/21/mehr-ram-im-powerbook/">German quote</a>)</em>, I ordered some this week. This means, I will address the <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/01/macminiinside/index.php">challenge of opening the Mac Mini</a> soon.

Especially as the hard drives shipped with the Mini are not pretty fast either (and therefore the Swap space is even slower than it "usually" is), I expect the upgrade to be a true relief -- because currently, the constant swapping of memory content to the hard drive and vice-versa is the most annoying thing about the little barebone sitting on my shelf.

I'll keep you posted.


<em>P.S.: The "last words" up there I just made up myself, but they are an intentional reference to the last words attributed to the <a href="http://de.wikiquote.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>: ("Mehr Licht" = "more light"), just in case you didn't notice ;)...</em>
