<blockquote><strong>Albert Einstein</strong>, when asked to <strong>describe radio</strong>, replied:

<em>"You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is <strong>no cat</strong>."
