Funny, topical as always, and subtly critical of Firefox's rapid release cycle: A Geek and Poke comic called <a href="http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2011/10/hyperinflation.html">"Hyperinflation"</a>.

I love G&P. To my great dismay, I was not able to use one of them in my master's thesis a few years ago, even though it would have been right on the money. Worse yet than referencing Wikipedia in your academic paper, printing a web comic as an illustration of the underlying problem that sparked the research might have blown my respected Alma Mater's mind, and we wouldn't want that to happen, would we.
