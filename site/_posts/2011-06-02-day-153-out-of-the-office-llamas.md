I would like to nominate this as the coolest out-of-the-office note I've seen so far :)

Today's useful fact comes once again from Wikipedia, that helpfully suggests not to confuse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama">Llama</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lama">Lama</a>. Thanks! (To further confuse you: In German, the animal is spelled with a single L, and therefore the two terms coincide. Wah!)
