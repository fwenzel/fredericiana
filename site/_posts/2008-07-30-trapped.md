Oops, a rock slide trapped us in Whistler: <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/07/30/bc-highway-rockslide-whistler.html">"Rock slide closes Vancouver to Whistler route" (cbc.ca)</a>

Luckily, there's still time until Friday to clean it up. Had it happened on departure day, there'd be over 400 flights to reschedule. Good times.

<strong>Update:</strong> The story of Mozilla being trapped seems to get a little press feedback: On <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2725">ZDNET</a>, for example, and the local press wants to cover our experience as well.

<strong>Update 2:</strong> The highway is to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/08/02/highway-clear.html">reopen today (Saturday) night</a>, they say.
