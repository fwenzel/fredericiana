title: Reddit's Fail-Alien (or "Fail-ien?")
---

Reddit's mascot stands by its side, in sickness and in health.

Time for a new member of the [fail pet](/tag/failpet/) family! It's been a while since I took this screen shot, but there used to be a time when Reddit was almost infamously unstable -- like so many popular Internet services a victim of its own success.

Here's what you might have seen on a particularly bad day. Harsh, isn't it?

Luckily, those days seem long past. I haven't seen Reddit truly break in a long time, though it does quite frequently get agonizingly slow, presumably every time college classes are over for the day in any given time zone.

**Side note:** Wow, it's been a long time since I last published a [fail pet](/tag/failpet/) on my site. Have most services stopped using them? Or maybe I was just slacking. Probably.

By the way: If you come across a "fail pet" online, **send it my way!** I'm [@fwenzel on twitter](https://twitter.com/fwenzel).
