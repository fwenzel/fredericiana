These are two bikes I saw in Mountain View today: First, a bike with a Chrome logo wheel. Luckily for onlookers, they used the old Chrome logo, not <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/03/new-chrome-logo.html">the one that made the Internets shudder in horror a few months ago</a>. Next to it, its little sibling, the Google bike. These small, colorful bikes help Googlers get across their ever-growing campus in no time. (Historical tidbit: Before Mozilla moved to Castro Street, we had bikes as well, to move between the two buildings we occupied. In the meantime, we just have to take a quick trip up or down the stairs to get to other parts of the office).
