What the heck? This morning, a <strong>laundry truck</strong> ran into the hotel's power transformer, leaving the entire hotel <strong>out of power</strong>.

Now it's (barely) running on emergency power (needless to say the Wifi is on that emergency power as well), while we are waiting for a replacement generator. Chances are though that due to the fantastic <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2008/07/30/trapped/">rock slide</a>, it has to take the <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=d&saddr=Vancouver&daddr=49.887557,-121.437378+to:Whistler&hl=en&geocode=&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=8&via=1&sll=49.784811,-123.085327&sspn=2.01805,5.822754&ie=UTF8&z=8">long route</a> so that could take a while.

Good times.

<strong>Update:</strong> Since 2:30pm, the power's back on. Yay.
