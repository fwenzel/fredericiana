... left until my <em>departure to the U.S.</em> *hooray*

By the way: I switched to <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> yesterday (it's easier to handle <a href="http://fredericiana.de">two blogs</a> on the same software) and after some web research I found a really cool theme for it (do you like it?).

I also wrote some new software called <strong>phpMyiCal</strong>, a PHP script that allows you to store and share your iCal / Mozilla Calendar files online in a MySQL database (it's probably compatible with <a href="http://phpicalendar.sourceforge.net/">PHP iCalendar</a>, also). I'll release its beta version for you to check it out, soon.
