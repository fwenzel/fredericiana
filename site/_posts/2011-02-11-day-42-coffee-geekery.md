After having abandoned my last coffee grinder when moving from Germany, today, I finally re-added an espresso grinder to my lineup, so I can get back to making great espresso at home. I got a Lelit PL 53, which is a grinder made in Italy. How appropriate, considering I bought both my espresso maker and the coffee beans I am currently using in Italy as well.

The first grounds I made today were incredibly fine. So fine, in fact, that I was unable to push any water through it in my espresso machine and had to restart from scratch. Wow! When I got an espresso out of it after a few tries, it was strong (a little overextracted still), but delicious. Good start!

I'll draw a few more shots during the weekend to get as close as possible to the perfect setting for the coffee I currently have, but so far, I am highly pleased.
