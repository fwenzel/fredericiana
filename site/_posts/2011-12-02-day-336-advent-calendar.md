As is tradition, I have an advent calendar again this year! Obviously it's the chocolate kind. I like the scene on this one ("363 days without workplace accident", haha).

By the way, not sure how that's handled elsewhere in the world, but every German kid has an advent calendar (chocolate or not) and it's the best thing ever while anticipating Christmas.
