I just stumbled across a collection of <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/70-nice-and-beautiful-firefox-wallpapers/">very nice Firefox background images</a>.

<img src="/media/wp/2008/07/firefox-thunderbird.jpg" alt="" title="Firefox/Thunderbird Wallpaper" width="500" height="216" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1338" />

Some of them I've seen many times (like "always wear protection", which always reminds me of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/511867206/">"natural mail enhancement" pic</a>), others are new to me, but they seem to be the work of some <em>very</em> talented designers in the Mozilla community, so make sure to check them out.
