Two items you probably couldn't have found in unmarried Fred's apartment ;) A candle next to a miniature Eiffel Tower. This is a three-exposure HDR shot, which not only brings out the glittery candle, but also gives the Eiffel tower a magical glow. Another thing I really like in this shot is the reflection next to the candle, which (I think) comes from the glassy candle holder.
