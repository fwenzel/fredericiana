Today is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">tenth anniversary of 9/11</a> but as I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fwenzel/status/112948149391327232">tweeted</a> earlier, I didn't notice any excessive proclamations of patriotism here in the area. Fewer flags than on Fourth of July, for sure. And I am pretty sure this bus already carried its five-star, five-stripe flag yesterday, and it probably still will, tomorrow.
