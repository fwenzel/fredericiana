Twitter's <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2009/08/01/why-wikipedia-might-need-a-fail-pet-and-why-mozilla-does-not/">fail whale</a> has a little friend, a <strong>fail robot</strong>. Not sure how the two relate to each other, but it seems the whale comes out when twitter struggles under the sheer load of tweets, while the fail robot denotes service errors not caused by load?

Now, <abbr title="Feel free to call this a Germanism, or better yet, based on a quote from ancient Roman politician Cato maior: &quot;We cannot control the evil tongues of others; but a good life enables us to disregard them.&quot;">evil tongues</abbr> would claim that there's so much fail at Twitter that a single <em>fail pet</em> just doesn't do it justice... But, knowing how challenging it is to scale a service to millions of users, I wouldn't quite dare to say so -- and therefore, I welcome the poor injured robot to my <a href="http://fredericiana.com/tag/failpet/">fail pet collection</a>. Quick! To the fail pet emergency room!
