Yay! <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espntv/espnTopics?topic=ESPN_EURO08">Apparently</a>, the Euro 2008 soccer games are going to be broadcast on ESPN. Lucky me that I just moved into my new place that comes with a full cable package :) Phew!

Looks like I now have an important appointment today at 2:30pm!

<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://blog.jeanpierre.de">Jean Pierre</a> mentioned that <a href="http://zdf.de/">zdf.de</a> actually also offers a <strong>live stream of the Euro 2008 soccer games</strong> on the web. Awesome! So far I haven't been able to try out if it works in the US too though, as my internet connection is not quite strong <strong>here.

Update 2:</strong> Well hello, there's a live stream for the US too on <a href="http://video.uefa.com/Video/Live/Competitions/EURO/Country=US/MatchList.html">uefa.com</a>. <em>(Thanks for the link, Tim!)</em> And it even seems to have quite a bit more games on it than the German stream which only covers Germany's games. Tomorrow afternoon, I'll check it out!
