Is this one of those words that we might have to import into English straight from German, for lack of a native term? It's the half/half mixture of apple juice and sparkling mineral water, making something like a poor man's Gatorade. While the commercial drink is apparently <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17693686">more apt for rehydrating professional athletes</a>, this drink is cheaper, and arguably much more delicious... and does its job just fine for casual exercise.
