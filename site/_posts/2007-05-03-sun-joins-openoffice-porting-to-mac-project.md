<img src='/media/wp/2007/05/sun-openoffice.jpg' alt='SunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s engagement in OpenOffice.org' class="alignright" align="right" />I'm delighted to hear that <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/GullFOSS/entry/sun_microsystems_engineering_joins_porting">Sun announced</a> today <strong>joining the Mac OSX port</strong> of <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>.

Sun, who founded the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice project</a> by open-sourcing the StarOffice program code shortly after they acquired its former vendor StarDivision, are going this way due to the increasing use of Macs. They write:

<blockquote>Why is Sun joining the Mac porting project? If you look around at conferences and airport lounges, you will notice that <strong>more and more people are using Apple notebooks</strong> these days. Apple has a significant market share in the desktop space. We are supporting this port because of the interest and activity of the community wanting this port.</blockquote>

I am very glad to see this happen as it makes a native "aqua" port of OpenOffice much more likely to happen in this century than it was ever before.

And since most people at Mozilla are using Macs these days, this seems to be something to look forward to for a whole bunch of people.
