I am happy to announce that starting this week, April 1, (and no, that's not an April Fool's joke) I am working full-time on the <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/">Mozilla WebDev team</a>. I have been involved with the Mozilla project since 2006, and I have since been able to experience just how great all of the Mozilla community is. I am looking forward to working with the many awesome people who make Mozilla what it is, and who are as excited about the future of the Open Web as I am.

There is a lot in store for us: Firefox 3.5's release is rapidly approaching, and the Web is concerning more people in the world than ever before. Though it is not all "smooth sailing", and there are a lot of dangers for the Open Web and for the people who use and rely on it, I am still, or maybe all the more, excited to make a contribution to the development of the Web landscape, for the good of millions of Firefox users, and <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">1.5 billion Internet users</a> as a whole.

Let's do it!
