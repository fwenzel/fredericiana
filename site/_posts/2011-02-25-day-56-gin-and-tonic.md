Say hello to my favorite long drink. Tara bought me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_lime">key limes</a>, so I had to try them out, right? They are actually quite delicious. The last time I had a key lime-infused G&T was in Key West, where they were actually yellow (thus: riper), and more mellow. But their greener counterparts are just as yummy.
