I just did a <em>"teenager audio test"</em> and I was actually able to hear the sound (though it almost curled my toe nails because it's so unbearable):

It's amusing how the website reads:

<blockquote>[This is] a tone that is generally only heard by people under the age of 25. It has been used as a <strong>deterrent device to keep teenagers from loitering in malls and shops</strong>, and sounds similar to a buzzing mosquito.</blockquote>

(emphasis mine). That reminded me of my first---and probably only---visit to an <em>Abercrombie and Fitch</em> store in a Florida mall that I left as fast as I went in, driven out by the ridiculously obnoxious "store smell" they were spraying there (though there seem to be people who <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061221113813AANthvl">like it</a>). Seriously, if I wanted to smell cheap cologne, I'd talk to some poor, drunk souls at the friendly neighborhood dive. But in general, I appreciate stores that don't need to drug me to make me buy their products...
