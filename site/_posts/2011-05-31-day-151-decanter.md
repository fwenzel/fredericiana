Here's a little trick for drying bottles that I found out also works fairly well with our decanter: Dry it as well as you can, then roll up a paper towel and stick it into the bottle/decanter, making sure not to touch the bottom. The water will evaporate and be soaked up by the paper towel within a few hours.
