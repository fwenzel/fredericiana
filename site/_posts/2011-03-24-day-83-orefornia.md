A view of Mountain View's Castro Street this morning. All of Northern California is spending these weeks under a deeply dark cloud of constant rain and windstorms, with such fun events as (according to last night's news), flood warnings for all counties except Santa Clara (phew, at least we dodged <em>that</em> bullet).

When I moved here they told me, the weather is always nice in the Bay Area. They tricked me! What is this, Oregon? ;)
