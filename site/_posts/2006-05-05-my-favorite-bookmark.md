To keep track of <a href="http://del.icio.us/freeed/">my numerous bookmarks</a> on the Internet, I use the popular bookmarking service <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, along with a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1532/">handy Firefox extension</a>.

Well, when you accidentally hit the "tag" button on a newly opened tab in Firefox, this is what happens:

You are bookmarking the unbelievably useful website <a href="about:blank"><code>about:blank</code></a>.

Due to the <em>ginormous</em> amount of information stored on that web page, I decided to keep the bookmark as a valuable resource for my daily Internet research (after all, it is the "home" page in my web browser and thus the first page I ever see when opening Firefox). ... And so did <strong>2362</strong> other people who were as <del>stupid</del>smart as me to bookmark <code>about:blank</code> ;)

<strong>Update:</strong> ... and counting...: There are already 2374 people besides me, now :)
