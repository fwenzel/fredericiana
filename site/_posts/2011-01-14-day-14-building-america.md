This is one of the aforementioned (Day 12!) yellow Union Pacific Railroad engines that seem to have a nest around here. I am pretty impressed by how much weight they can move around -- and besides, the patriotic flag and slogan on the side is a great reminder of what the railroad has been doing for this country for centuries: Building America.

This photo is a tiny little bit grainy due to the high ISO value I picked because it was getting dark already. Ah well!
