Today was the first day of Open Source Bridge in Portland, a great, volunteer-run Open Source conference. Quite appropriately, yesterday was also the first time I ever gave a <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/576">talk</a> at a conference (if you care: slides are <a href="http://mzl.la/playdoh-osbridge">here</a>). Thanks to the OSBridge people for giving me the opportunity!
