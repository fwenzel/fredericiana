Some delicious Coloradan IPA, out of my favorite American beer glass. It's a Black Dog Ale glass from <a href="http://www.blackdogales.com/">Spanish Peaks Brewing</a>, which coincidentally is also from Colorado. Now I only need to actually have that beer sometime and not just fill the glass with replacement brew from the same state :)
