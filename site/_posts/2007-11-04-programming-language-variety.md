I just noticed that during the last few weeks, through the projects I am working on and classes I am attending now, the number of programming languages I am handling on a daily basis has increased to six:
<ul>
	<li><strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, for <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org">AMO</a> and similar</li>
	<li><strong>Perl</strong>, for <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Bouncer">Bouncer</a></li>
	<li><strong>Python</strong>, for <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Kubla">Kubla CMS</a></li>
	<li><strong>C</strong> for my Systems Architecture and Parallel Programming classes</li>
	<li><strong>Visual Basic</strong> for an older in-house software project I am maintaining</li>
</ul>

(Let's not mention the occasional line of Assembler that programming assignments tend to require ;) )

I am excited: More variety spices this all up a little. Though sometimes the drawbacks in the respective languages become all too obvious when only days before you have done the same thing in another language with 2 lines of code and today you need 20 to do it elsewhere. But I guess the motto of the <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt email client</a> does apply to programming languages too:

<blockquote>All programming languages suck -- some just suck less :)</blockquote>
