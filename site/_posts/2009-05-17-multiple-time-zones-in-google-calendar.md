Google Calendar has a new feature that many <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2009/05/15/mozilla-across-the-globe/">international Mozillians</a> may like: It can now display more than one time zone at a time. In my case, lining up the Central European and Pacific time zones next to each other comes in quite handy:

<img src="/media/wp/2009/05/gcal-timezones.jpg" alt="Google Calendar: Time Zones" title="Google Calendar: Time Zones" width="304" height="294" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2237" />

Of course, when entering a new event, it does not seem to allow selecting the time zone this refers to quite yet, let's hope that'll be fixed in a future iteration.
