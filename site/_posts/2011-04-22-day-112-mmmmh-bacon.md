Mmmmmh. Breakfast for dinner! Is there anything that doesn't get better when combined with bacon?

Now, besides the awesomeness that is bacon, I am quite sad how f-ed up the color (hello, red!) is on my camera phone. I wonder if something broke or it it's just the phone's inability to handle indoor lighting? Hmmmmmm.
