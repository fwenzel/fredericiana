Since I last <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2010/07/20/next-steps-for-the-copy-shorturl-addon/">blogged</a> about the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/197224/">Copy Short URL</a> add-on, I stumbled across another, very popular example of automatically exposed short URLs:

<strong>Wordpress.com</strong> as well as <strong>self-hosted Wordpress</strong> instances have automatic short URLs now, starting with Wordpress version 3.0.

For example, <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/08/a-proof-that-p-is-not-equal-to-np/">this blog post</a> on wordpress.com about a possible proof for P != NP has the shiny short URL <a href="http://wp.me/pr9Ir-1lN">http://wp.me/pr9Ir-1lN</a>.

A recent blog post on <em>my</em> blog, in turn, has: <a href="http://fredericiana.com/?p=2921">http://fredericiana.com/?p=2921</a>.

Of course, it's a little sad that the auto-generated short URLs on self-hosted Wordpress instances are so <a href="http://www.sheeptech.com/wordpress-ugly-permalink-as-short-url-for-twitter">ugly</a>, and they are not really short enough to use them easily on twitter or with other character-sensitive applications. But considering how long your average blog post URL is in the first place, it seems like a great win nonetheless.

An unrelated side note: I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=582699">filed a bug</a> to <strong>expose bugzil.la URLs</strong> on <strong>Mozilla's bugzilla</strong> instance. It's not picked up or resolved yet, so if you want to see the support as much as I, feel free to comment on or CC yourself on the bug!
