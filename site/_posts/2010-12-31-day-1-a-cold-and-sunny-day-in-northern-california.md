<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/5308211573/" title="Day 1 - Cold but Sunny! by Fredâ€‹, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5041/5308211573_dc2deba3cd.jpg" width="493" height="500" alt="Day 1 - Cold but Sunny!" /></a>

The first shot in my <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2010/12/31/my-project-365/">Project 365</a>. People going on a walk on a cold, but sunny December 30 in NorCal.

I took this pic with a 200mm tele and manual focus. It is also cropped, straightened and saturated a little bit.

Of course, I am two days early for a 2011 start, but rules are there to be broken, right? :)
