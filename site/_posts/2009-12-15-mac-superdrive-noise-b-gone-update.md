When skimming through my pending Mac OS&nbsp;X upgrades this morning I noticed one saying:

<blockquote>This update eliminates the <strong>noise made by the optical disk drive</strong> during system startup and wake from sleep on MacBook computers.</blockquote>

Wow. As long as I've been using a Mac, the <em>sweep-sweep</em> noise has been characteristical for a Mac startup sound, reminiscent of the <em>floppy drive seek</em> sound computers made when they still came with floppy drives (yes, dear children, I am that old).

I wonder what this was for in the first place. Maybe to find out reliably if there is a disc in the drive already? &lt;crystal ball&gt;Possibly, the operating system did not check again and just relied on the hardware status flag being set correctly on startup, and if it was wrong, evil things could happen?&lt;/crystal ball&gt; And now, almost suddenly, the Mac engineers found out that it is unnecessary altogether? The wonders of Snow Leopard.

What comes next? Removing the <strong>gong</strong> on boot to avoid Mac-obsessed college kids from making fools of themselves during lectures? ;)
