Okay. My Mac Mini's graphics interface died after 6 weeks of usage. Just like that. The system ran well, (meaning I could play around with it via SSH) but it was kind of "headless" without displaying anything. Who needs a monitor anyway??

<img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/85759173_ff9adfff60_m.jpg" alt="Mac Mini; CC-licensed; Source: http://flickr.com/photos/darice/85759173/" class="alignleft" />Apparently, this is not a very rare problem, as there is already a <a href="http://www.info.apple.com/kbnum/n300583">support page by Apple</a> addressing the problem. Anyhow, resetting everything doesn't really help a hardware error, so I brought the box downtown to the <a href="http://www.csnw.com/">local Mac store</a>.

From Germany, I am quite used to sometimes getting the worst customer service ever (though it has become better since the last European customer protection laws), so I was (and still am) sceptical how/if they will repair it and how much they want to get for it.

But, Apple is quite famous for its good customer service, so I am quite confident that they will do a good job to my Mini, too. For now, I am at least impressed that I can <a href="http://www.csnw.com/service">check the status of my repair online</a> and get quite a few interesting pieces of information:
<ul>
	<li>Your "mac mini 1.42 combo" was received at our Corvallis location on Friday, January 27</li>
	<li>Your system arrived at our service center on Friday, January 27</li>
	<li>Diagnosis was performed by our technician</li>
	<li>We ordered parts for your system from the manufacturer on Monday, January 30</li>
	<li>We received parts for your system on Tuesday, January 31</li>
	<li>Work was completed on your system on Tuesday, January 31</li>
	<li>Your system is being transported</li>
</ul>

<strong>Not bad!</strong> There are not many companies that have such a transparent repair process. Now they only have to call me tomorrow for picking the box up and not make me pay anything for <em>their</em> hardware problem and I am truly happy.

The real test if a Mac is worth its money, to be continued ;)
