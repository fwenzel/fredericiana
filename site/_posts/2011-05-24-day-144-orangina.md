I like Orange soda, like the French-origin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangina">Orangina</a>. It actually tastes quite close to (German) Fanta, which is yellow and might even have some orange in it (something I can't say about the American kind). Both of them are second on my list only to San Pellegrino Aranciata, the contender of Italian origin.

You'll notice I said "origin" twice which is because both of the "old-world" sodas have meanwhile been acquired by ginormous companies and are now marketed by those as part of their brand portfolio, and with little to nothing to do with where they originally came from. Which is also how they end up in American grocery stores. But unlike Fanta, which apart from its name shares not even a close resemblance between countries, at least these two taste the same as in Europe, as far as I can tell.
