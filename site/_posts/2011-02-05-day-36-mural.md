This is a mural at the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto. Reminds me of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=lyon+mural&w=70748623%40N00&z=e">many murals</a> we saw in Lyon, France. Not-so-coincidentally, this mural depicts a French street. Is there an unwritten rule that all American murals must show scenes from France?
