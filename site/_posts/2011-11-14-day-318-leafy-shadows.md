A street light, casting some nice shadows through the leaves of a tree.

So far, I like how my new lens performs, particularly in low light conditions. I also started shooting some of my pictures in RAW format, as it lets me squeeze more contrast out of a picture that might turn out too dark out of the box. Finally, I played with a purple filter here (digital, not optical), which I think it gives the picture an awesome touch.
