Yesterday was the national holiday of Germany: The 3rd of October is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Unity_Day">German Unity Day</a>, commemorating the anniversary of the German reunification in 1990.

Google Germany made a special logo for it and put it on google.de, which I think looks pretty cool:
<img src="/media/wp/2008/10/germanreunification08.gif" alt="" title="German Reunification 2008" width="276" height="110" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1662" />

My humble self obviously had to go to work anyway, as foreign holidays tend not to be observed over here ;) but we coincidentally ended the day with dinner at a fancy fish restaurant, which counts as celebrating, doesn't it?
