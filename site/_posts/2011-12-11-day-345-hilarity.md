Two strangers, having a blast at the Mountain View Farmers' Market.

I like the picture: I think it captures a candid moment very well. What's not so great is the partial blurriness and the high DOF, which makes it feel kind of busy. That said, perhaps that's exactly what one can expect from a place frequented by so many people.
