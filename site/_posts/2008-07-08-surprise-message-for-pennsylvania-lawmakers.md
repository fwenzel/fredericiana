Apparently, in 2003, Pennsylvania <strong>abolished the "helmet law"</strong> forcing motorcycle riders in the state to wear a helmet.

As a result, people are less inclined to wear helmets <em>(first surprise)</em>, according to a <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08165/889612-85.stm">recent study</a> head injuries needing hospital care due to motorcycle accidents went up 87% compared to before the law fell <em>(second surprise)</em>, leading to a rise in the resulting medical care costs for these injuries of 132%.

So, Pennsylvania gets rid of their helmet law, and now they act surprised that people leaving their bikes the direct way are more likely to suffer severe injuries? What the hell?
