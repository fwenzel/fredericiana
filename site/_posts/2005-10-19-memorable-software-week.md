That's kind of nice. Two very nice pieces of software hit "magical mile stones" these days.

My favorite web browser <a href="http://alex.polvi.net/2005/10/19/100000000-downloads/">Firefox finally got unbelievable 100 million downloads</a>. <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/say-cheese.html">Celebrations!</a> It's one of the most wonderful open source software products I've ever seen. Go <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">spread the word</a>! :)

Another nice one - closed source though - is the voice over IP service Skype (not a <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2005/10/18/why-not-call-your-child-google/">google or yahoo toy</a>, by the way, but soon an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4237338.stm">eBay</a> one) that will finally break the four million users mark this week. In my opinion, it is still the <a href="http://fredericiana.de/archives/2005/09/10/mit-skypeout-nach-hause-telefonieren/">best possibility to call home</a> so far. It works unbelievably smooth even though the people I'm usually calling are roughly 5000 miles away.

So, it seems to be totally the right moment for me <a href="http://osuosl.org/news_folder/studentdev">to get employed</a> at the <a href="http://osuosl.org/">OSU Open Source Lab</a> soon. It's a good week, really :) w00t!
