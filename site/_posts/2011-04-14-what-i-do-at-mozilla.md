A few months ago we founded an experimental new "rapid web development" team at Mozilla, nicknamed the <strong>"Flux" team</strong>. Its purpose was to take care of a growing number of <strong>short- to medium-term web projects</strong> at Mozilla.

The team focused on two areas in particular:

<ul>
	<li><strong>software lifecycle management</strong>: establishing project management guidelines and driving web software projects from idea to completion (including their eventual retirement). The team also served as stewards for externally developed projects.</li>
	<li><strong>streamlined web development</strong>: reducing the amount of nonfunctional overhead when developing Mozilla web apps, while ensuring consistently high quality standards across projects.</li>
</ul>

The experiment proved successful: Together with a number of internal and external groups, Rapid Dev successfully released <strong>more than a dozen projects</strong> of varying size around the release of Firefox 4 and Firefox 4 mobile.

But along the way it became apparent that the two focus areas mentioned above are different and challenging enough to stand on their owns, so we rearranged the group accordingly, spawning the <strong>Web Productions team</strong> (led by <a href="http://ryansnyder.me/post/4553850749/what-im-doing-at-mozilla">Ryan Snyder</a>) and the (new) <strong>Flux Development Team</strong> (led by me, <a href="http://fredericiana.com">Fred Wenzel</a>).

The web productions team will continue to run Mozilla-internal web projects, but has also branched out into fostering community-sourced projects and similar endeavors.

On the Flux Development Team, I am working with a team of (so far) three excellent engineers (Dave Dash, James Long, and Anthony Ricaud) on web development for various parts of the Mozilla community.

To evolve our development platform, we are also compiling and maintaining reusable code (libraries) as well as engineering best practices for web projects. One tangible artifact of this work is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh">playdoh application template</a> mentioned above, which is a bundle of libraries on top of the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web application framework. Its code and documentation is intended to benefit the Mozilla and open source web development community as a whole.

Besides developing new applications on this base, we are also going to introduce new tools and improve engineering processes for established projects like mozilla.com.

Say hi to the new Flux and Web Producers teams!
