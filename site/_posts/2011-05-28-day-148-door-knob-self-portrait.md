Today I noticed that our door knobs are not only randomly reflective but also shiny enough to provide a lot of detail. Time for a photo! As you can see (even better in the enlarged version), our dog decided to have lunch at the same time, so now she's on the Internet once again. That's what she gets for walking into the frame!
