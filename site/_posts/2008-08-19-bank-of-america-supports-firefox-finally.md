From the "announcements" section of Bank of America's online banking:

<blockquote><strong>Firefox is now supported by Online Banking.</strong>(New)

Experienced Firefox users and customers interested in using Firefox can conduct Online Banking activities knowing that the browser is fully supported. For information about settings that will help you get the best possible Online Banking experience with Firefox, visit our Browser Help and Tips. </blockquote>

Glad to hear!
