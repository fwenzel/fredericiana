<blockquote>Lenovo, one of the world's biggest PC manufacturers, is to start <strong>selling laptops to business and consumers with Linux pre-installed</strong> on the machines.</blockquote>

That's good news, I guess: In particular when you don't want or need an instance of MS Windows preinstalled on your machine, you can now finally avoid the <em>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_tax">Microsoft Tax</a>"</em> that you currently have to pay no matter what, just to delete it off your box once it arrives. It may also give customers an idea of how many dollars they actually spend on Windows, because nowadays many still believe "Windows was for free, it came with my computer"...

Apparently, earlier this year Dell already announced it would start shipping Linux PCs also.

Way to go, Dell and Lenovo!
