<strong>Friday</strong> is approaching fast. It'll be my <strong>last day</strong> as an <strong>intern</strong> with the <strong>Mozilla Corporation</strong>!

<img src='/media/wp/2007/03/mozilla_mascot.png' alt='Mozilla Mascot' class="alignleft noborder" />It was a fun and exciting time, and I learned a lot. Six months long, I was working full-time on the Remora (addons.mozilla.org version 3) project, and during my journey through the complete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">software development lifecycle</a> I got to tackle quite a few tricky issues that turned out to require new and unique solutions that I really enjoyed inventing and implementing (to use morgamic's recent words: <em>"things you can't google for"</em>), and I am proud that part of <a href="http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/addons/">all this</a> now carries my signature (if you are interested, at the moment, that's something like 60.000 lines of code svn <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.svn.c.blame.html">blames</a> on me).

Yet for now, I have to go back to <a href="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/index_en.php">school</a> and finish up my degree: After all, I want to become a <em>"Diplom-Informationswirt"</em> (that is, a Master's Degree in <a href="http://informationswirtschaft.de/en/ueb">Information Engineering and Management</a>), and that'll take me pretty much another four semesters.

I want to thank my fellow AMO web devs (morgamic, clouserw, shaver, sancus, fligtar and Cameron) for their (ongoing) work on the project, their efforts to get me integrated into the project and Mozilla in no time, and their constant valuable input on my work. Thanks to schrep, Mitchell, John and cbeard who did their very best to help me get the most out of my internship. Thanks to all the other employees who sparked my inspiration and expanded my horizons time and again in interesting conversations, presentations, etc. Thanks to dolske and faaborg who I never regretted to share a "cube" with. And last but not least to the countless others all over the Mozilla community who I got in contact with (and there were a <em>lot!</em>).

That being said, I'm not out of your hair yet ;)! Even after my return to the college campus, I'll stay on the Mozilla webdev team, and I'll keep contributing to Remora and other projects to come; only I'll be on IRC at slightly different times of day...

See you in Europe!
