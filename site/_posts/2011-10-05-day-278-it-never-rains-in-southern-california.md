Got on board a south-bound Bombardier Q400
Didn't think before decidin' what to do
All that talk of opportunity
TV breaks and movies
Rang true, sure rang true
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems i've often heard that kind of talk before

It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya
<strong>It pours, man it pours.</strong>
