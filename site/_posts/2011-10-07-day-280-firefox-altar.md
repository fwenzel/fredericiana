Last day of <a href="http://py.codeconf.com/">PyCodeConf</a>: As a conference sponsor, Mozilla got to put up a big Firefox banner, which was being held in place by two big vases, so it ended up eerily looking like an altar. No-one decided to sacrifice their proprietary browsers there (in a hugely dramatic act), but many seemed so inclined.
