The penultimate photo (!) of Project 365 is an HDR panorama of Milpitas Civic Center. Milpitas City Hall is the big building to the right, and on the left you see the community center with the Christmas tree in front of it.

Make sure to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/6603853567/sizes/o/">check out the full-size picture</a>. As an added bonus, you'll see the same kid running through the photo twice -- a neat "time lapse" effect of stitching multiple exposures together.
