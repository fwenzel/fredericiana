Haha, you've got to be kidding me. A pet carrier in front of your belly? <em>"Order now! Now you too can be at the receiving end of jokes all over your community!"</em>

I mean, this thing is probably imitating a baby sling, but unlike babies, animals can actually walk.

Which reminds me of a pet peeve of mine (how punny, I know): <strong>doggie strollers</strong>. Chances are, if you take your dog on walks more than, say, twice a year, and unless your dog is disabled or very, very old, it will easily be able to walk further than you. Even if not: Stop being so egocentric to take your dog on trips that exceed its stamina. Depriving a dog of the pleasure of running around and sniffing to its heart's content just so you can treat it like a baby is just sad.

So what's up with that?
