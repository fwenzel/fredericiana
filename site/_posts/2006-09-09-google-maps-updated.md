This was blogged at least a million times today and it was <a href="http://digg.com/software/New_Google_Maps_Aerial_Satellite_Photos_Update_September_8_2006">dugg</a>, too. Google updated their photos in Google Maps and Earth all over the world.

This includes high-res pictures of many metropolitan areas. But it was a real pleasure to see that my university city in Germany now comes with the highest possible resolution Google maps has.

Look at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=49.004321,8.408918&spn=0.022241,0.052657&t=k">whole downtown area</a> or at an overview of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=49.011056,8.413993&spn=0.003779,0.010407&t=k&om=1">university campus</a>. That's amazing!

The pictures, by the way, seem to be from early 2005 judging from the fact that the new 24-hour library which was opened a few months ago is still heavily being built on in the picture.
