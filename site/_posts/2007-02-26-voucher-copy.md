Funny, the German <strong>Heise Verlag</strong> sent us a voucher copy of the current issue of <a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/">c't</a>, because it contains a small article about Firefox 3 including the new Gecko 1.9 rendering engine (page 39).

As the person here who's most fluent in German, I inherited the magazine and will gladly read it soon. Thanks for passing it on to me, <em>pkim</em>! (And thanks to Heise for sending us a copy of their magazine).
