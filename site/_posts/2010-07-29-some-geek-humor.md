Look what <strong>last.fm</strong> has in their <a href="http://www.last.fm/robots.txt">robots.txt file</a>:

<pre>User-Agent: *
...

<strong>Disallow: /harming/humans
Disallow: /ignoring/human/orders
Disallow: /harm/to/self</strong>

Allow: /
</pre>

Oh, who wouldn't like geek humor :)
