When my girlfriend recently tried to access <strong>Craigslist</strong> on her French dorm's internet, she got this instead:

<blockquote>According to the current security policy, the URL you have requested is blocked. 
Host : 'www.craigslist.org' 
URL : '/...' 
Categorie : '<em>Pornography and Sexually-explicit Content</em>'</blockquote>

Weird.

Maybe somebody should have told them that <strong>regex-matching agains three-letter words</strong> is not exactly the best method of keeping your students from surfing around on "dirty" websites?

The page she wanted to see was a harmless "best of craigslist" story after all -- I doubt it would survive long on Craigslist otherwise.
